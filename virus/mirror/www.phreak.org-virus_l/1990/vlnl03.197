VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: New Anti-virals from McAfee's BBS uploaded to SIMTEL20 (PC)

The following new anti-virus files were obtained directly from McAfee's
Homebase BBS at (408) 988-4004 and are now available on SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
CLEAN71B.ZIP    Universal virus disinfector, heals/removes
SCANV71B.ZIP    VirusScan, scans disk files for 160 viruses
VALIDATE.CRC    From McAfee BBS: CRC validation list of pgms
VSHLD71.ZIP     Resident virus infection prevention program

I have also posted the ZIP files to Usenet's comp.binaries.ibm.pc.

Here is an excerpt from the doc file:

WHAT'S NEW

        Version 71-B of SCAN fixes a problem with version 71 in
identifying viruses imbedded in files with non-executable
extensions.

        Version numbers 68 through 70 were skipped because of the
appearance of trojan version 70 of SCAN in Israel.  Rather than use
the next number in the series we are skipping to version 71.

        Version 71 of SCAN now includes an option that allows users
to scan for new viruses by adding their own set of search strings
loaded from an external virus data file.   When this /EXT option
is enabled, a user-specified set of scan strings will be scanned
for by the VIRUSCAN program.

        We have also removed the extinct viruses from their extinct
category.  The extinct category was less than enthusiastically
received by our users who relied on SCAN shell routines written by
third party authors.  We will wait until these shell routines can
handle the additional /X switch before we place these viruses back
into the extinct category.

        Version 71 of VIRUSCAN adds sixteen new viruses, bringing
the total number of known computer viruses to 160, and known
variants to 239.

    We don't have a stated policy as such.  Nothing written down that
addresses the problem in general.

    We use Disinfectant and GateKeeper Aid (with GateKeeper for those
who want to read the docs).  Since we are almost exclusively Macintosh,
we have no set procedures for IBMs.  Every time the question comes up
the answer is different, because the question is asked infrequently.

    We have Disinfectant and GateKeeper (and family) on our Public File
Server.  We also distribute them freely through our Consultants and
Student Assistants; we have a standard anti-viral disk which we copy
freely to anyone who brings us a floppy.

    Documentation changes with each update, so we don't keep hardcopies.
The documentation for Disinfectant is internal to the program, and
GateKeeper's documentation is available with GateKeeper itself.  In
addition, we have three small help files that we update regularly.

>- - How do you respond to calls from users?  Personal visits (for things like
>  networks or hard drives),  have them come by in person (like for a diskette)
?

    Rather than visit them personally, we try to teach them to handle
the problem.  That's pretty easy to do with Disinfectant so handy and
free.  If it's a floppy we also invite them to bring them in, and we
try to get them to bring blank disks so we can make antiviral disks for
them.  If there's no other recourse (the user is unable to handle the
problem, or under a deadline) we'll make a housecall.  It's just that
housecalls are time-consuming and there are only so many of us.  User
self-sufficiency is much preferable.

>- - Do you have penalties for users caught knowingly spreading a virus?

    Not expressly stated, but that would fall under a violation of the
Dartmouth Computing Code of Ethics, which states, in part:  "No one
should deliberately attempt to degrade system performance or to deprive
other users of resources or access to any College computer."  Though
intentionally spreading viruses doesn't fall directly under the Code
unless the virus is spread to a College-owned machine, it violates the
spirit.

    We've never had a problem with intentional spreading, though.
(Knock on wood.)  I hope we never do.  We could probably answer
persistent malicious spreading with disciplinary action.

>- - What packages do you use/recommend?  Are they commercial or
>  shareware/public_domain?  (We're on a budget here;  guess which kind we're

    We use and recommend Disinfectant and GateKeeper Aid.  We make
GateKeeper available for those who want more protection than
Disinfectant INIT provides, if they are willing to take the time to
read and understand the documentation.

Subject: 4096 mutant? (PC)

few days ago, I received a message from Martin Ederveen, one of our
system administrators:

>This morning a student came to me with a floppy on which there was a virus.
>He said he had only copied a small program from TUE [Technische Universiteit

I asked him which program it was in, but he didn't remember. He said he
thought it was PD software, though. And he told me that PC tools showed the
real file length of infected files.

Though I know quite a bit about the innards of the PC, I am not familiar with
viruses. I guess I'm with the "lucky" few who haven't been infected by a
computer virus ever. But since I'm subscribed to VIRUS-L and VALERT-L, I
thought you would like to know. Is it false alarm? (guess not).

Subject: help needed to write an anti-viral program...

In the past few weeks, one of our student use microcomputer labs has
been repeatedly infected with the STONED-B virus. What makes the
problem difficult, however, is that NONE of the disinfect programs we
have tried (F-PROT, M-DISK, Cleanup) seem to be able to remove it
properly. It appears that the partition table on these machines is not
in a standard location, so after the virus is removed, the partition
table is invalid and the machine will no longer boot from drive c:.
Using information I received second-hand from Mike Lawrie
(ccml.rures@f4.n494.z5.fidonet.org) I wrote a short C program to copy
the bytes in head 0, cylinder 0, sector 7 to the h0,c0,s1 and
everything seems to work ok (the program does NO error checking,
though, so its quite dangerous to use). This led me to a bigger
endeavor, though, and I need some help.

	I once saw a program called PC-LOCK by Johnson Computer
Systems that password protected a hard drive by 1) invalidating the
partition table so an attempt to get to drive c: after booting from
drive a: would result in an "Invalid drive specification"and
2)installing a device driver upon bootup from drive c: that asked the
user for a password and locked up the machine if failure. I have been
trying to duplicate the functionality of this program without the
password protection code (too much of a nuisance for lab use). This
program was able to prevent boot sector viruses from ever getting to
the hard drive by virtue of the invalid partition table, and I'd like
to write my own program to do this (of course, if code already exists
(that DOES NOT ask for a password) please let me know). So, my
question is this: Can anyone explain to me (or send me code :-)) in
detail how the hard drive boots up?? I understand fairly well how a
floppy disk boots, but I dont understand the relationship (or the
code) between the master boot record/partition table and the partition
boot code (the one affected by sys c:). If I can actually figure out
this program, the resulting code will be placed in the public domain!
Thanks for any help provided.

There are, and have been, a number of hardware products for data
security.  An outfit called Cylink has a card which does data encryption,
thereby (hopefully) preventing any "subtle" damage to your data.
PC-cillin incorporates a plug very much like the copy protection "keys"
some programs have that fit onto the parallel port; in this case it
stores the system ifnormation *off* the hard disk.

Can you send the name and address of the manufacturer of this device?

First, I'd suggest that you make sure it is not in memory when you start.
 Boot from a "known clean", write protected DOS disk if you have it, or
check with SCAN or F-PROT to make sure your memory is not infected.
F-PROT will also remove the infection on the infected disks.

Belately he remembers that BRAIN does not infect hard disks, so simply
rebooting from a hard disk will ensure you are clean.

Having ensured that you are clean, in one of these ways, SYS the infected
disks.  The rewriting of the boot sector will deal with the BRAIN
infection.

If you can get it, F-PROT is probably the most effective solution.  i am
assuming, however, that you are wanting to know what you can do *now*,
without looking for it.

Subject: Re: PKZIP Auto-Verification feature.. (PC)

There's another way the Authenticity Verification of PKZIP might have
been fooled, though I doubt it was done this way, for reasons given
below.

As far as I know, PKUNZIP simply checks to see if the unzipped file
contains the same encrypted key that the file was originally zipped
with.  Thus, the trojan author could have gotten a valid serial number
from PKWARE and zipped the file with it.  Upon unzipping a message
would be displayed that the file was authentically made with *A VALID
SERIAL NUMBER*.  Not necessarily the right serial number.  Does anyone
know if the Name associated with the serial number is displayed upon
unzipping so that the user can confirm that the data was not just
zipped by *someone* with an AV serial number, but by the person whom
the user expects to have zipped it?  I can't check this myself as I
only have the export version of the software.  (Silly damn NSA....)

I presume, however, that the folks at PKWARE could determine which
serial number was used to zip the file, even if the current version of
their software doesn't display this information upon unzipping (well,
of course it wouldn't display the serial number, I meant to say the
name), thereby nabbing the culpret.  This seems almost too obvious.
Has this been considered?  It would be awfully funny if whoever did
this had given themselves away thinking they were clever enough to
outwith the AV.

Subject: Virus attacks on workstation class machines?

friends,
   i am having a problem with virus paranoia here.  maybe it is legit.
please help me.

   management is very scared of individuals downloading code from
places such as uunet, gatekeeper, and any other source such as an
archive site or postings in news.  thier philosphy is "if you can buy
it then you can't use it". thier reasoning is that companies that sell
software are liable for damages.

   the problem i have with this is it ignores work such as X-windows
from MIT, andrew toolkit, serpant, ...  corporations aren't the only
sources of good code.  besides, where do you think corporations get
the personell to write the code?  places such as MIT and the FSF
provide source.  this is good code.  how much are you going to spend
to get source from a corporation?  a lot i suspect.

   the typical scenario is someone in management picks up a magazine
and reads about another PC or macintosh virus and assumes the same is
true for workstation class machines.  therefore (and i am quoting)
"all public domain software is riddled with viruses".

i am the system administrator for a network of sun, NeXT, and pc
computers that are used solely for software development (not my
primary job, i'm a software developer).  my philosphy is "allows the
users to use whatever tools and environemnts that maximizes thier
performance but must be compatable with the other individuals on the
project.  this includes the free flow of information".  so, i'm trying
to maintain a network that is as open as possible within the
corporation but externally restrictions apply.

what i am looking for is documented cases of virus attacks on
workstation class machines.  i know of none.

flood me.

flood me about the morris thing which was a worm, not a virus.  what
was the methods of his attack?  if i recall correctly one of his
methods of attack was a sendmail bug (which by the way was part of
SunOS--something we purchased.  would Sun be liable here?).

how can if reach CERT electionically? (i think it's CERT isn't it?)

[Ed. cert@cert.sei.cmu.edu]

i'm looking for virus checking software.  what is available?  how do they
work?  who is the experts?

i need to become smart in this subject so that i can keep a productive
environment for our developers.

please reply by email.  the company turned off the news spicket
because of that nasty public domain software can be posted in any
group (link comp.sources) and anyone reading that group can extract
and install it.

Regarding PKZIP authenticity verification...

>[Ed. Sounds (to me) to be at least a rudimentary public key system of

When you receive the registration notice, you are given the name you
chose to register under as well as (for me at least) a 9-digit number
that seems to be based on the string in some way.  The string and the
number are then entered into the PUTAV program that verifys them and
encrypts them into the PKZIP.EXE program.  If either the name or the
9-digit serial number are mis-entered, PUTAV flags an error.  When the
AV is verified during an UNZIP, your name and a 3-character/3-digit
code appear.  Presumably, PKWARE maintains a listing of names, serial
numbers, and result codes.  I would guess that people could
(additionally) verify programs by calling PKWARE and seeing that the
name matched the result code.

However, I doubt that PKWARE is going to flaunt the code around just
to prove that it's secure.

>Also, I assume that PK is maintaining the database of developers'

You either register for AV when you register the program, or you can
get one afterwards.  All you provide them with is the name you want to
appear when the AV is verified.

>Making the (rather broad) assumption that the system is

One particularly attractive feature is that the AV registration does
not cost the registrant anything--PKWARE isn't charging to provide
this service, at least not above what they charge for the program.

I agree with Mr. Ed Murphy.  You can get rid of the WDEF virus by
rebuilding the Desktop on your hard disk.  HOWEVER...  you have to
keep in mind that just inserting another (infected) floppy disk can
re-infect you.

The WDEF virus, and other implied-loader viruses which reside in the
Desktop file are probably the most infecectious disk-based viruses ever.
This is because merely inserting a disk can cause infection.  This makes
WDEF & MDEF the fastest spreading and most common viruses in the Mac world.
Fortunately they are easy to guard agains:  use the Freeware program
"Gatekeeper Aid" which can be run without "Gatekeeper" and can be used in
addition to most (all?) other virus protection programs.  Gatekeeper Aid
intercepts and removes WDEF & other Desktop-file implied loader viruses
on contact, ending the nuisance of this type of virus once and for all.

My guess  is that you were infected with two viruses (or more?) viruses,
or have other damage to your system which looks like an infection.  SAM
always identifies implied loader viruses and wouldn't notify you of a
"possible virus" when there's a WDEF infection, it'd inform you of a
"WDEF infection" -- unless you have an ancient version of SAM in wich case
it shouldn't notice a WDEF infection at all.

It's still true, but insufficient.  In the same digest your message was
published in, somebody else was saying how using virus disinfectant
programs is never enough in the PC world and that one should always
replace the files from backups.  Well, in the Mac world the opposite is
true... always use one of the leading virus removal programs, don't rely
on any other method.

It's been said before, here, and I'll repeat it.  THE way to deal with Mac
viruses is by using the EXCELLENT freeware programs Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper
Aid, and the latest version of Disinfectant and the Disinfectant INIT.  Only
a very exotic and brandnew virus could get past these, and the authors, who
deserve to be showered with medals have a track record of updating their
programs in record time -- usually within days of the isolation of a new
virus.

Subject: Replies to 'Keeping icons off the screen' (Mac) (Summary)

Netters...

Thank you for your overwhelming replies to my question of : 'If your supervisor
has a problem with the use of virus control programs, how can you still use
them and not have them appear at startup/or on the control panel?'

Anyways, here is a summary of the replies I received :

1.  To keep the icon off the desktop at startup : Gatekeeper is easy to do.
    It contains a switch in it's control panel which will keep it from
    appearing on the screen.  However, Gatekeeper Aid is not as simple.
    Quite a few people recommended that you change the icon to the 'neutral
    grey' that is the desktop color at startup (so that it just blends in).
    I think this will work, especially if you put a tilde before the name
    (like ATM does), so that it loads up LAST.  This puts neutral grey
    on neutral grey, and also puts it at the end of the row of icons, and
    voila!  it will disappear.

    I have yet to test this theory, but I did some preliminary testing with
    a 'generic' INIT that I keep around for such purposes, and it seems
    to work fine there.  Hopefully I will be able to do the same to
    Gatekeeper Aid.

2.  How to keep Gatekeeper out of the control panel : The solution seems
    to be unanimous.  Change the file type (using ResEdit, or Desktop) to
    INIT, instead of cdev.  this will convince the Control Panel DA not
    to load it.  I tried it, and this works great.  Thanks!


Perhaps I should also note that most of the replies also gave me an address,
or told me where to look for the address of the gentleman who wrote
Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid.  Quite a few told me that they would contact
my supervisor themselves, if that was necessary, to attempt to convince
him that this software was in the public domain, and it is a wise thing
to keep around.  To all of you, once again, thanks for your support.

This story does have a happy ending : several people from our own
Microcomputer support center (here at Penn State) also contacted me, and
told me that they would call my supervisor as soon as possible to attempt
to explain to him what Gatekeeper was, and to give him a new copy of
Disinfectant 2.4.  Thanks for your help as well.
