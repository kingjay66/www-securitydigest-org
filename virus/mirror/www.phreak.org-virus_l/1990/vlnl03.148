VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

This is NOT a precedent, or even a good analogy.  Physicians do not
administer any medication, vaccine or otherwise, without understanding
the risks and benefits.  Patients do not get vaccines without consenting.
Granted, some patients may not understand all the risks of a vaccine
but that probably is because they do not ask.

In the situation described, there is no informed consent and to my
mind such a program is no different than the virus with which it
competes.

I see two problems with the comparison of the polio vaccine to
hunter/killer viruses.

1) Human beings, despite genetic variations, still run pretty much
   the same "operating system". Even in cases where the polio vaccine
   becomes virulent, the body has built-in anti-viral defenses. This
   is not the case for computers. Computer "biology" (in terms of
   operating systems) is evolving at a rate many orders of magnitude
   faster than is human biology. Sooner or later, a computer virus
   will hit a situation with which it will be unable to cope.
2) It is not currently possible for anyone with the motivation to do
   so to reassemble an existing biological virus into a different
   virus without a lot of expensive equipment and a far greater
   amount of technical expertise than is available to most people.
   The virus "writer" often only needs a byte-level editor and very
   little expertise to turn out a variation on an existing virus. This
   could as easily be a bad as a good variation.

Subject: a NEW virus? (PC)

Hello,
My father have a problem in the last month.
the problem description follows:
He is using a PC/XT computer with HD and Printer.
He's at the last month started to print lot of stuff on the printer.
the stuff includes Word-Processor program and Quatro's PIC files.
from time to time when he prints a lot of pages - even with breaks
but without turning the computer OFF. there are chars that are not
printed ,Unknown chars printed ,Form Feed printed.
this is not a problem in the printer/Cables as I'll show now.
two days ago I started the computer from a fresh DOS disk (not HD)
and formatted another diskette with /S option. put on it a protection
TAB and gave it to my father to use as the BOOT diskette.
Since than nothing appened even though he printed 40 pages at one time.
from the BOOT disk he loaded only Quatro files (Quatro & hebrew suport)
and the Word-Processor.
When usualy from the Hard-Disk he loaded DOS a HD manager program
and than the above mentioned programs (Quatro & WP)

so the problem might be a virus BOOT sector or FILE or Partition.
I checked with some packages the HD and found - NOTHING.
So I assume it's a File virus ( If it was BOOT it was cause I replaced
the boot sector for protect).

Does anyone of you can help me detect that virus or problem?
(It's better using the HD the boot from floppy)

Subject: Anti-viral viruses

It seems to me that many people are forgetting how biological vaccines
work.  Now, it has been sometime since high school biology, but I
*thought* that vaccinations worked in this manner:

    A weak strain of a virus or a "cousin" of it (ie, cowpox) is
    administered to an individual.  That person's body then reacts
    by making anti-bodies that "fight" and "kill" the weak strain.
    These anti-bodies stay around for quite sometime, which then
    help prevent infection of the more potent varities of the virus.

Notice, it NOT the vaccine that protects the body, but the body itself.
The vaccine kind of give the immunity system a "jump start" so that it
can be prepared for certain types of infections, because it "knows" what
to look for.

Computers are like people with AIDS or those borne with no immunity
system: No protection whatsoever.  But, we can give computers a type
of protection with certain programs.  Innoculations can be thought of
in the manner of a list of known viruses and their identifying pieces
of code and manners of infection (knowing what to look for).  Boosters
can be periodical updates of the database of known viruses.  But even
this immunity system can't look out for everything.

I don't see much help in the way of having anti-viral viruses as
competition for "nasty" viruses either.  I don't know all that much
about viruses (I just read this discussion to try to be an "informed
user"), and I don't see where or why a virus would worry about
competition for infection.  I seem to recall hearing/reading about
programs that have had multiple infections.  I think that in order for
an anti-viral virus to be busy enough to act as competition for other
viruses, it would also have to be busy enough to compete with the real
programs that we are trying to use.  Sorta defeats the purpose,
doesn't it?

I just don't see much use for anti-viral viruses.  I'll just try to keep
a write-protect tab on all my floppies, and a winter coat to protect
against the cold.

Subject: DM/Viral Naming

	Recently, Mr. Y. Radai wrote on the use of the Disk Manager
read-only capability for virus proofing. While that may work well
for an experienced person in the micro, for the macro, it would mean
yet another set of drivers for technicians at large installations
to keep handy. Further, any extended partitions created with DM
require a unigue file (DMDRIVER.BIN as I recall) to access them.

	Since our procedure with a suspected virus is to boot "bare"
from a write-protected floppy and not execute ANY file from the
suspect system until proven safe and we have enough trouble with the
Bernoulli RCD driver and Zenith ASGNPART, to add a unique driver to
each machine would be a logistical nightmare (I already carry four
re-configurable boot disks).

	He is correct in stating that while the read-only attribute
in DM is software and trivial to bypass, no known virus even looks
for it so would probably be effective.

re: viral naming

	Personally, I would prefer a descriptive name rather than code
numbers for designation. In the first place, a virus can have several
different numbers (Jerusalem: 1792, 1808, 1818. see also 450, 453,
460, etc.) depending on which characteristic is noted. Next, I have a
a time remembering if the new stealth virus is the 1260 or 1253.
Finally, a descriptive name is easier to remenber since there are
meaningful associations (e.g. 1701/1704 vs Cascade).

	Several times people including myself have tried to classify
viruses. I use a code for memory residence that some people seem to
like (Rs, Rh, Rt...) since it aids in diagnosis if something unusual
pops up (4096 is a Rh and easily detectable when resident because of
it), but is more for deciding if a machine is infected rather than
something to call it.

	In any event, I would like to cast a vote for more meaningful
names than simple numerics. Certainly, Arcturus and Betelguise are
more elegant names for stellar bodies than their codal equivalents.

				Oh well, 0 Sirius.

Greetings:
        We are a very small company (read I am the whole computer department)
who are running several IBM PS/2s . We have not been bitten by any "nastys"
yet, but one of the bosses friends has. As a result, I have been "asked" to set
up a CERT (most likely just me). I would like to request some assistance from
anybody on this list in setting up. Please feel free to recommend/knock any
products and give any advice on writting the necesary procedures.
        Please,please respond to me directly and not to the list. I will
summarize if anybody answers. (How about it DC, FRISK et al.? I RREEAALLYY need
some help here!)

This is actually an illustration of why "anti"-viruses are a bad idea.
First of all, the administration of the polio vaccine is done on an
individual basis.  No-one is vaccinated unless a doctor confirms that
it will be safe and effective for that individual.  Some people
*don't* receive the vaccine, because there are possible risks.  (For
example, anyone with a weakened immune system wouldn't receive it.)
Even more significantly, the vaccine is not given (or precautions are
taken) if anyone in the same household as the patient has a weakened
immune system.  That is, the live vaccine is not given if there is
even a slight chance that it would be passed on to someone else.

"Anti"-vaccines don't fit this pattern, because they are spread
without any concern for their suitability on particular systems.
Also, by their nature they inevitably spread to other systems which
may not be able to tolerate them.  Like the polio vaccine, if
administered indiscriminately they would end up causing serious
"infections".

   Robert
