VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

   SELF destructing programs are one thing, programs that hold your
computer hostage are another.  It was distributed the way free bars of
soap are distributed.  How would you like to get a bottle of detergent
in the mail that said in fine print "This bottle of soap is not free,
if you use it, send $189.00 to blah blah.  If you don't, you won't
like the consequences.".  Since of course no one reads junk mail, you
use the soap.  It then commences to turn your clothing blue.  THEN you
read the bottle to see what is going on.  If the manufacturer wasn't
arrested, I would sue them for damages.

Nonsense! There are only 64 bytes there and only the half of them are
not used (these at offsets 11h, 13h, 1Bh-2Dh, 34h-3Fh). And even if
someone is smart enough to write such a small virus (which I claim to
be also impossible on 80x86 based computer), these bytes are not
directly addressable. This means that you cannot *execute* the code
which resides in them. You have prior to extract it (using some IN and
OUT instructions). But the code, which will be able to do this *ought*
to reside somewhere else.

Yes, it is possible to design a virus, which will be able to use the
CMOS RAM as a storage for, say, some flags, but not for its entire
code!

Looks like a new one to me!  Very preliminary (possibly wrong)
description:

  - Infects both EXE and COM files.
  - Once the virus is in memory (after the first infected file
    is executed), any vulnerable COM or EXE file that
    is executed via INT 21h function 4Bh will become infected.
    (Vulnerable COM files are uninfected files larger than 999
    bytes and smaller than roughly 62500 bytes; vulnerable
    EXE files are uninfected and larger than about 1500 bytes).
  - If the current month is September, October, November, or
    December, all writes done via INT 21h function 40h will be
    interfered with (the write-buffer register will have 0Ah
    added to it before the write).

This is all from disassembly, not from testing!

The virus is quite unreliable; it loads its resident part into address
9800:0000, without first checking to see if that memory is in use, or
even exists.  The virus will therefore not work on a machine with less
than 640K of memory, and it will cause malfunctions on any 640K
machine that is *using* 9800:0000 for something.  It also does some
rather cutesy things to try to defeat people trying to execute it from
within a debugger, and to take over INT 21 without anyone noticing.
The things add to the unreliability of the virus, but don't make it
significantly harder to detect or analyze.

Here's one possible scan-id (good term!):
22032E8B1E9B00B440CD218B

This may be of use to anyone who "accidentally" downloaded and tried
out the code from VALERT-L!  (Personal opinion: this virus is
incompetent enough that it will always be rare, if it doesn't
immediately go extinct.)

Under the United States 1909 revision of the Copyright Act, it was
indeed true that if a copyright owner failed to meet the formal
requirements of a copyright notice cast in the correct format, the
work was automatically forever thrust into the public domain.
However, with the advent of the 1976 revision of the law, notice
standards were somewhat loosened.  If an author failed to publish the
notice as prescribed by sections 401-403, the copyrights would not
always be forever lost or injected into the public domain, provided
that "the notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively small
number of copies...dis- tributed to the public" [the courts will have
a heyday with the term 'relatively small'] or that "registration for
the work has been made before or is made within five years after the
publication without notice, and a reasonable effort is made to add
notice to all copies...that are distributed to the public in the
United States after the omission has been discovered" [the phrase
'reasonable effort' is another one of those rubbery concepts] (see
section 405, subsection (a), clauses (1) and (2)).

It should also be noted that anyone who innocently infringes a
copyright where the copyright notice has been omitted, "incurs no
liability for actual or statutory damages...if such person proves that
he or she was misled by the omission of notice". (see subsection (b)
of section 405)

So, no longer is a copyright truly invalidated forever due to lack of
copyright notice.  This would imply that the author of a viral code
could legally retain rights of authorship in a work not registered for
copyright and for which the work has been released publicly without
proper copyright notice.

However, other sections of the Copyright Act (and other tort laws)
would likely govern the issue of whether or not viral code is proper
"copyrightable subject matter" in the first place.  It is not very
probable that the Register of Copyrights would allow the registration
of viral code.  On the other hand, they seem determine that "in
accordance with the provisions of this title [Title 17 - Copyrights],
the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject
matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason," and could
thereby refuse registration. (see section 410, subsection (b))

Just a few thoughts to further muddy the waters.

QUESTIONS:

1.  Why on earth would law-breakers expose themselves to the arms of
    justice by attempting to enforce viral code copyrights?

2.  If viral code is really able to be legally sanctioned by Title 17,
    can anti-viral authors freely write programs without infringing
    the "derivative work" right of the viral code copyright owner?
    (see Copyright Act definition of derivative work and section 106,
    subsection (2))

Unlikely to be practical, I'm afraid?  For instance, if the program
waits for user input, or looks at the time or date, or reads from a
file (I can't think of -any- program offhand that doesn't sometimes do
at least one of these), the pseudo-executor would have to
pseudo-execute a separate instance of the program for every possible
input/time/data-item.  Not likely to finish within the life-expectancy
of the user!

The PC Cyborg AIDS diskette did include a sizeable program (AIDS.EXE)
containing lots of code and data for administering a questionaire and
giving AIDS-related advice.  I can't speak for the *quality* of that
advice, but the program was definitely non-trivial.  The only negative
thing I know for sure about it was that it refused to run unless the
nefarious INSTALL.EXE had been run first.  (Of course, there may once
have been some non-nefarious INSTALL program that also set whatever
flag AIDS.EXE looks for.)

Your action seems completely reasonable.  Why in the world would
anyone without something to hide want to have it not be known that a
virus was loose?  While this person may have been embarrased by the
fact that people could figure out that he was the one who introduced a
virus, it's certainly more important to stop the spreading than simply
preserve his own reputation.  And after all, he didn't deliberately do
it (I presume), so why not try to stop it?

I don't think that painting the Scarlet-V on his character is proper,
but then I don't think that is what you intended with your e-mail.
Whether the e-mail did or not, though, is up to personal opinion
(IMHO).  But if you tried as best you felt you could to preserve his
anonymity, then I feel this was a correct and reasonable response to
the infection.

In any case a license is a contract and contracts are governed by
contract law.  Just because something is stated in a contract does not
make it legally binding.  The contract must abide by contract law.
For example a copyright must meet certain qualifications to valid.  It
must use the word "copyright," it must appear in an obvious place
(where it cannot be overlooked), and it must state what rights are, or
are not, granted.  If if fails these requirements it is not a valid
copyright.

For example, let's say I include a copyright in a program I write in
some obscure place in the program.  Someone then copys and uses my
program in a way forbidden by my "copyright" notice.  Since my
"copyright" was not obvious (to a reasonable person) it would be
invalid.  The same logic applies to license agreements.

To state in a license agreement that using a product without paying
for it will cause intentional damage most certainly violates the law.
Therefore such a license agreement is not valid period!  To say the
program will not function without payment is not illegal, and
therefore is valid in a license agreement.  A self-destructing program
is simply making itselft non-functional.  The AIDS trojan willfully
destroys another person's property.  These seem like quite different
situations to me.

I have experienced similar behavior on some of my Macs.  I usually
found a system resource was trashed.  Rezdet, part of MPW, would
pinpoint the offending resource.

I now leave the system locked.  This prevents the problem
I was having, but also prevents other things, like changing the
desktop pattern.

I attributed the problem to programs crashing under MultiFinder.

To the best of my reccollection, the vers resource was the one usually
trashed.  Sometimes deleting the bad vers would remove the problem and
the system's growth.  At other times, the system would need to be
restored from backup.

I now lock system as a matter of course.  Can anyone come up with a
reason why this would be a bad idea?

If that is the case, the proper thing for his attorney to do is:

1) don't fight extradition
2) file an immediate lawsit for specific damages in the courts

The suit shaould name anyone who printed anything in anyway that
explained on how to "clean" the system of the protections. The damages
are (# of disks distributed)* US$378 . This is based on the fact that
there is no idea on how many people read the articles that told how to
"break through the copy protections" but that all owners of the disks
have the capability to do so.

Then there is the damage to the "good name" of PC Cyborg... I would
hate to be one of the publishers of a magazine that told people how to
"get rid of the AIDS trojan."

This has been a very expensive lesson.

Well, I got an emergency call from a friend of the family this
evening, and I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about the
problem she had...
  She's working on a Mac SE, 20 meg Apple drive, system 6.0.4/finder
6.1 (I think, its the 107K version that comes w/ 6.0.4), and after
about 2 months of using it, calls me with this problem:

    The Mac's trash can icon has disappeared, and there's a message at
the bottom of the screen, 'based on a program by Encore Systems' or
something close to that...  Also, the menus are messed up: File has
'New folder' and 'Close', edit, view, and the apple menu are fine,
Special had no entries originally, and there were 3 extra menus: one I
can't remember, a 'style' menu, and a 'attrib' menu.

    I had her replace the finder and the system files separately in
the system folder, checking for invisible files with Disktools II (but
I didn't recognize any), and it still didn't work.  FInally I had her
remove system and finder into separate folders, and rename the system
folder to 'old sys' and copy the system folder from a locked System
Tools floppy, and when she rebooted the problem remained.

        If you have any ideas as to what this might be from, PLEASE
respond ASAP via Email (and posting here if you want) because she is

Subject: Ohio Virus: Old Dominion U (PC)

  As part of the procedure to erradicate the BRAIN virus from the
academic community at Old Dominon, we are requiring that all students
have their diskettes scanned before using our labes.  During one of
these scans - the OHIO virus was discovered on a student's disk.  I am
presuming that the OHIO virus is similar to the BRAIN virus but ...
any information on the OHIO virus would be appreciated.  Thanks
