VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

- ----------------------------
Now, my contribution:

   I have run into similar problems with Word Perfect in 2 different
environments here at the University of Ottawa.  (No Windows involved.)

   First, we have students using WP on Novell LANs with each station
having one floppy disk.  The software resides on the server, and the
student must keep all of their own files on (a) floppy disk(s).  In the
1989/90 academic year we were running WP 5.0.  Our technicians are
convinced that at least partly problems of TRASHED FATs, and resulting
loss of files, is caused by students changing floppy disks while in the
middle of an editing session without informing WP of the change.
Perhaps the required sequence should be SAVE (F7 OR F10), then change
disk, then read directory of new floppy (F5), and then continue with new
diskette.  The problem may also come from either using timed backup or
automatic backup after a SAVE.

A second environment resulted in very similar problems.  We had a
small group of 3rd world special students (we call Pearson Fellows) for
whom we had a 6 machine lab with 2 floppies in each, but no hard disks.
Again we were using WP 5.0.  I had quite a few instances of trashed FATs
from these students.  In many cases I was able to at least partially
recover the files using NORTON and finding clusters that followed each
other (logically, if not physically).  It was a painful and time
consuming process.  Again the problem SEEMED to be that Word Perfect was
getting confused about where to put files on floppies, with our
technicians alleging that the students were randomly changing the
floppies.  I don't know.

   However, I had a similar trashed FAT problem when the student was
using Harvard Graphics.  Since the HG files are compact, recovery
was easy, again using NORTON.  I don't believe that disk changing was
a problem in this case.

   We scanned our software and data disks using the then current
versions of McAfee's SCAN and did not identify any viruses.

   I was present once when something like Jean Coppola's problem
occurred to one of our Pearson fellows.  WP seemed to take over when I
did a search to end of file (my memory of exact sequence is hazy).  The
result was multiple copies of the file.

   For all of these problems Word Perfect hot line consultants could
only suggest that maybe there were problems caused by an unusual
combination of keyboard and machine interacting with the software to do
strange things.  Our machines are non-brand-name clones.

Subject: VMS Virii? (VAX/VMS)

I found the Unix virus discussion most interesting. Can anyone similarly
discourse on VMS?

A request: Can anyone recommend a reference or two on DOS (there are
only a zillion I'm sure, but I am mortal and my time is limited) that
would help me follow someof the technical aspects presented in this
list?  I find it interesting and informative to know that virus X does
such and such to the partition table at sector Y track Z.  Many of the
dos texts that have come my way tend to be a touch too general or
don't hit on the topics I would like to follow up on.  Thanks in
advance!

P.S. I will soon post a summary on the responses to my questions on
viruses and University Policies.  Let me say this: It appears most of
us are dealing with things on a day to day basis -no that's not right.
It seems like out of sight out of mind, but be prepared.

                 BEIJING VIRUS (a.k.a. "Bloody" virus)

December 7, 1990

New virus discovery.

First reported appearance on a number of computers in the Civil
Engineering Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(M.I.T.) in Cambridge MA, USA.

Mr. (   ) had been experiencing strange events with several
systems. Running Vi-Spy showed that there was an un-explainable
2048 bytes of RAM that was "hidden" from DOS. Mr. (    ) used
Vi-Spy to acquire the partition table and boot sector into a file
which he then sent to RG Software Systems, Inc.'s Virus Analysis
Lab (VAL) where the code was dis-assembled and analyzed. Within
24 hours after receipt of the virus sample, an identification
pattern was developed and an updated "emergency release" of Vi-
Spy was shipped overnight to Mr. (    ).

Type of Virus: PC DOS Boot infector. Infects Partition Table (Master
                    Boot Record) on hard disks as well. (Drive
                    C:)

Vector:        5 1/4" Diskettes only.

Types of computers susceptible to infection:
               PC's and Compatibles with 640k or more RAM.

Infection acquired by:
               Attempting to boot from an infected diskette,
                    whether or not the diskette is "bootable".

Symptoms:      Available RAM size decreases by 2048 bytes.
               3 1/2" diskettes become non-readable.
               Occasional "garbage characters" appear on screen.
               Diskettes that were "bootable" will no longer boot
                    the system.
               5 1/4" High Density diskettes may show "0 bytes in
                    1 hidden files" as a message from CHKDSK.

Danger level:  Considered to be a very dangerous virus in that it
               may cause damage to any diskette or hard disk due
               to bugs in the virus that can cause it to write to
               the FAT or the Root Directory.

Naming convention used:
               This virus was named for the political statement
               it attempts to make. The following message is
               stored in encrypted form. Due to a bug in the
               virus' decryption routine, the actual message may
               be displayed as garbage characters.

               Encrypted message: "Bloody! Jun. 4, 1989"

               This is the date of the Chinese "Tianamen Square"
               confrontation between rebelling Students and the
               Chinese Army in Beijing.

Technical Notes:

1. Trigger mechanism for message display: The first appearance of
the message will be 1 - 128 system boots, then every 6 boots
thereafter.

2. This virus attempts to save the original boot sector into
another sector, however bugs can cause it to just replicate
itself into both sectors. Thus no automatic clean-up can be
reliably performed unless the original, un-infected Partition
Table and Boot Sector are available to use in a replacement
operation.

There is no attempt made by the virus to determine what type of
disk is in use, thus the damaging effects are produced due to its
always writing to a fixed number of disk sectors, no matter what
disk mapping is in effect.

3. The virus intercepts all diskette reads and writes where it
checks for its infection through a comparison of the 1st 6 bytes
of sector 1. If the disk is not infected, it adds itself to the
disk.

4. Detection avoidance techniques used by the virus:
When attempting to infect, if the write fails, it tries one
additional time, and then aborts its infection attempt. Therefore
the user doesn't notice a failure when the disk is write
protected. Also, the virus bypasses DOS completely when
intercepting diskette reads and writes. Thus, a program that
monitors system interrupts will not see the activity of this
virus.

*************************************************************

Note: Since this report has been completed, the Beijing virus has
also turned up in another department at M.I.T. and has
simultaneously appeared at the City University of London.

This is the first time we've noticed a Boot Sector virus
appearing simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic, leading
to speculation that multiple persons were involved in its
release.

Researchers in the U.K. have named this the "Bloody" virus.

With the timing of this virus' release, there is an improved
opportunity for it to spread, through students' carrying infected
diskettes home for the holidays.

To help protect his privacy, the name of the individual at M.I.T. has been
removed from this report.

Subject: Possible Virus in TAME (PC)

What version of TAME are you using?  There was been several updates
recently which deal with Windows problems.  TAME250.ZIP is the latest.
It's available from SIMTEL20 in the pd1:<msdos.desqview> directory.

I use it with DESQview daily and have had no problems.

I think the author misses the drift of those requests.  I think they
were asking for software which runs in Unix and checks MSDOS
diskettes.  Cross products such as these are quite common for other
applications.  For example, in Xenix/386 I can manipulate MSDOS
diskettes..read, write, delete, format while under Xenix.  I also can
process arc files (and soon--zip files) while under Xenix.  I can even
develop MSDOS executables under Xenix.  With a virtual machine like
Vp/Ix I can even run MSDOS under Xenix.  If virus detectors and
removers for MSDOS viruses were available for Xenix, I would use them
rather than native tools on MSDOS.  I don't have to worry about
becoming infected by accident when processing MSDOS diskettes under
Xenix, even though the MSDOS diskette is infected.  Xenix and other
Unix systems are gaining in popularity on '386 and '486 mainframes.

Subject: re: WP Virus? (PC) and 4096 virus (PC)

I encountered the similar prolblem in WP 5.0 and WP4.2.  I posted a
message on the WP50-L and found many other people had encountered the
same thing. The following summarizes what I have found:

Apparently the WP file becomes corrupted by having an
unknown code inserted. This code cannot be deleted by WordPerfect.
Using WP doctor will clean the file or Norton Utilities to blank out
the bad code. As to the cause of the unknown code(s) ?

I would like to find out more about the 4096 virus, what does it infect
and how to get rid of it.   Thanks in advance.

	Since Mr. Glath neglected to include a signature string in his
VALERT posting, enclosed is a 16 byte id stringthat a user put on
HOMEBASE for use with John's SCAN v71 /ext switch:

   37 55 7b 78 78 73 6e 36 37 5d 62 79 39 37 23 3b

	I have not seen the virus so cannot attest to the string's

The Government Accounting Office (the investigative arm of the
Congress) recently released a report on computer security.  It was
made available on the Internet, although for the life of me I cannot
remember where I found it.  I could not find the quotes that were
mentioned in Davids post, but have included the contents page from the
report to describe what it contains.  It may be of interest anyway to
those that have not already seen it.

The report is 112962 bytes in length, so I will only post it if there
is sufficent interest. (I'll let the moderator be the judge of
"sufficent interest").

========================================================================

I have seen quite a few references in this list to Music-Bug. What no
one has indicated yet is that Music-Bug is a "true" virus. ie. It can
re-infect from the corrupted hard-disk to other diskettes. Is there
anything in the code that would "trigger" this infection on some date
or time? What is the impact if the hard-drive is not-disinfected?

We've seen Music-Bug at our site. Just on the SVGA-Utilities
diskettes, though.  Apparently, other locations are finding it on the
COMBASE diskettes, too.  Once our infected machine was cold-started -
the music stopped and little impact was seen.

The SVGA-Utilities as delivered had "4 lost allocation units found in
4 chains" when we ran a CHKDSK against them.
