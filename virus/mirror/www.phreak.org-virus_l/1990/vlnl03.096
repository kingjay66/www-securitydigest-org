Subject: Re: Mainframe viruses

Dave Chess responded to Christian Reichetzeder's remarks by saying:

  "But viruses don't *need* to have the environment under their
   exclusive control, and neither do virus writers! ... All a virus
   needs to do is
      - Find out what writeable executables exist
      - Read from and write to one or more of them (in specific ways)"

This is true, as long as you have access to those executables you want to
write to.  Otherwise, you either get a violation (via ACF2 or RACF or
whatever), or you have to somehow circumvent the security system.  Take
the simplest case (although, this *rarely ever true*) of your account having
no write access to any files but your own, and noone else having execute or
read access to any of your files.  Then, by the former, the farthest a
virus can spread on it's own (notwithstanding sendfile, xmit, or whatever
file transfer service is available to propogate thru the mail system) is your
own account.  The latter means you have to get exclusive control of the system
at some point.

Also, George Roberts says that you only have to restore *your* account to
it's former state, and asks why restore anything if you want the virus to
spread (also in response to some of Christian's comments).

This is true if you never have to get control of the system itself, i.e.,
you have the access to infect files without having to bypass the security
system.  If you do have to get control of the system, then you'd better be
sure that you did restore it to its former state (I'm talking core/registers
here) or else you risk a system crash.  Then it would be all to obvious to
the systems people who would inevitably follow up by going through the logs
that you were the culprit, and they would probably ask you what the hell
you were doing messing with the system.  This is why you have to restore
the system to its former state.  The same thing applies if you remain within
your own account, you could easily crash your session, possibly bad enough
that you can't get logged back on.

>From experience (I agree with Christian), I'm more concerned with
system/program bugs than I am with viruses.

I believe AVS gives false signals.  It said that I have the 12 Tricks
type B virus on my original write-protected Microsoft MS-DOS 3.3
keyb.com file.  But only when I run the program specifying "a:*.*".
If I run it with the parameter as just "a:", it works fine.  Maybe the
same thing is happening to you.  And from what little info I have on
the 12 Tricks virus, it is not a virus but a Trojan horse so those
files can't be infected with it anyways.  I wrote mail to the auther
describing this, but I haven't received a response yet.

Subject: File tranfser of software--A way to curb commercial infections?

Hmmm...all this talk about validating through EPROM or putting the OS
in ROM got me thinking.(Hit the deck! :) )..

But seriously, isn't the problem here trying to protect yourself from
floppies or cartridge tape or removable media in general?  So why even
bother with removable media? Why not do like a lot of people in the
UNIX community do and get it via network distribution. (Note, this
does not mean I'm advocating that commercial software should be put up
for anon. FTP).??

It would seem to me that the vast majority of infections comes from
somebody sticking an infected disk in somebody elses machine and then
leaving the virus behind on their machine, or vice versa.  M.
Brainless decides to play Tetris on the company Mac thats used for
mastering their latest program and leaves a beastie behind. This then
attaches itself to the Gold/Key copy and is spread on every production
run of that particular program.

But if they'd left the master copy on a trusted machine, like the
company mainframe and just let it be up/downloaded to/by Joe Customer,
it seems like you'd stand a lot smaller chance of spreading something
than if you moved it to a series of unsecured duplicating machines.

I'm not saying this would cure everything, but electronic distribution
would go a long way to curbing floppy exchange/swapping as a vector
for virus propa gation.

You might argue that its inconvenient and would take forever to get a
"transmission slot", but look at it this way: Most businesses usually
have to use the company's central purchasing system , which means you
won't get it for a few months anyways, so what does it matter if
you're waiting for it to show up on your doorstep or on your
harddisk???---Plus you have a single source from which the program(s)
are distributed which is a lot easier to control than trying to find
machine #1316286179, fifth aisle, third row, 5th shelf from the top.

You are of course welcome to praise, flame, cut to ribbons, or
nominate for a Pulitzer anything I've said in here.  When doing so,
assume that the archive/sole distribution system is trusted and is big
enough to handle a moderate user load similar to an average FTP site.
Let me know what you think,

Subject: Macintosh MDEF/Garfield virus (Mac)

   We have detected what I believe to be a new Macintosh virus.  This
virus can be referred to as the MDEF or Garfield virus, for reasons
that will become clear below.  I'm passing along all that I have
verified about the virus.  Some local folks are working on further
analysis, and I will be sending samples of this virus to some of the
national anti-virus experts.

   This virus replaces the System file's native MDEF resource with a
new resource, named Garfield.  MDEF is a resource that is part of the
Mac's menu generation system.  The original MDEF resource is apparently
retained but given an ID of 5378; the substitute resource has the
normal ID of zero.  This new "Garfield" MDEF resource will propagate to
application files, and an infected application file can spread the virus
to a fresh System file.  The viral MDEF resource will also attach itself
to the Finder.
   After some period of time or after some set of actions, the viral
MDEF resource will delete itself from the System, resulting in the loss
of all menus generated by the System.  We have not yet tracked down the
details of the conditions under which this happens.

   The Vaccine program will successfully block an infection.  When
an application is launched, Vaccine will display a message asking if
you wish to grant permission to add an MDEF resource.  If you see this
message, you have the new virus.
   If you use the Virus Detective DA, you can add the following two
search strings to check for the new virus:
     Resource MDEF & Name "Garfield"
     Resource MDEF & ID = 5378
Using these two search strings, you should be able to scan your disks
for an infection.
   Disinfectant WILL NOT find this virus when it scans a disk.  This
is a new virus that this anti-virus program doesn't know about.

   At present, there is no software that will automatically remove
this virus.  The simplest solution is to replace all files that check
positive for an infection, and then use Virus Detective to rescan for
any signs of the virus.  More sophisticated remedies will certainly
be developed in the near future.

   It may be possible to repair an infection by (1) deleting the
"Garfield" resource from the System and changing the ID of the MDEF
resource that remains from 5378 to zero; (2) simply deleting the
"Garfield" resource from all other files in which it is found.  There
is no guarantee this will work, and it should only be attempted by
the technically venturesome.

 Greetings:

 The local PC folks agree that this is a good idea, but have no idea if anyone
 sells it, or how to do-it-yourself.

 If I am running an unproven "public domain" program, and have a floppy based
 PC, I write-tab protect or remove the system disk, just in case. This way I
 know that the program CAN'T zap my system disk (by accident or on purpose).

 I am looking for the same protection for a hard disk based PC, that is, a way
 to either write protect or turn off the hard disk. Just booting from the
 floppy is not enough. A dedicated virus still could damage the hard disk data.

 Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

How about if we forget that and instead start taking responsibility
for the security of our systems?  Seriously, the holes that Morris
exploited were well-known "features" of the sendmail and finger
programs for a long time that could ultimately pose a security threat
to systems which did not have them properly configured to close out
these holes.  IMHO, the only negligence is to be found in those who
didn't take the time to secure the holes.

Technical, legaloid note:If you still want to sue, you should probably
go for something other than negligence since programming in a
trap/backdoor requires somebody to perform the programming and is
therefore more of an act of commission rather than neglect(which is
just basically sitting back and doing nothing.

Subject: LZEXE vs Viri (pc)

Hi y'all--
I'm forwarding a message that appeared on a local BBS.  I guess that
it is related to the posting by James Ford (#91).  Apologies if this
has been hashed out earlier.  I am not sure, but I think that LZEXE is
a utility that compresses .exe and .com files, but still allows their
execution.

========================== Start Of Message ==========================

Re: LZEXE VS VIRI

LZEXE is wonderful (as I think we all agree) but.... suppose the program
you compress has been infected with a virus, I suspect the SCAN programs
will not recognize it. Further... suppose some one else (unsuspecting)
uploads a file that has been infected and compressed, it looks like a
standard EXE file. Now BBS SYSOPS scan the program and certify it since
SCAN missed the lurking virus.
Sure you could unsqueeze every file and scan and the squeeze back. Whew!
Of course maybe there is a silver lining... can a virus attach itself to
a compressed file?
Still will use compression but continue my fastidious backups.
Anyone else with comments or experience?

======================= End Of Forwarded Message ========================

Any comments/suggestions are welcome.

>From Federal Computer Week, 14 May 90, P.14 & 17             -- QUOTE --

Congress Expected to Pursue Stricter Computer Virus Laws

By ROBERT SMITHMIDFORD

In  the  wake  of  Robert  Morris  Jr.'s  conviction  for unleashing the
Internet worm in 1988, both the House and Senate are expected to take up
bills that would  make computer viruses  and other intentional  sabotage
specifically illegal.

  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) recently introduced the latest virus  bill,
S2476.  The bill would make it a federal felony to gain access to compu-
ters intentionally  and to  introduce distructive  programs that cause a
$1,000 loss  over the course  of a year.   Sabotage that effects medical
records would  also be illegal.   The bill  also would  allow people who
suffer  losses from a virus  or other  malicious  program to  file civil
suits to get compensation.

  According to Ron Palenski,  general counsel  for the trade association
Adapso,  Leahy's bill is stronger than pending  legislation in the House
because it expands what might  be considered a virus.   "The strength of
the Leahy  proposal  is that it takes  an interstate  commerce approach.
Since  virtually  anything is in  interstate commerce,  it covers almost
anything,"  Palenski said.   Current law covers  only computers owned by
the government or a  financial institution or cases in which viruses are
spread across  state lines,  he said.   Leahy's bill  also adds  viruses
embedded in software to its definition  of gaining access  to computers.
"The current statute is really written in terms of networks.  It assumes
that the vandalism  will occur  in networks,  but it can also  occure in
distributed software," Palenski said.

  However,  the bill might  be open  to modification.   In proposing the
bill, Leahy said,  "I want to ensure that in creating a private cause of
action to boost  deterrence we do  not open the  floodgates to frivolous
litigation.  I also look forward to tesimony from prosecutors and compu-
ter experts on the scope of the access definition, to be sure that it is
technically sound and a useful tool from prosecuting computer crimes."

  The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association applaud-
ed the legislation for focusing on criminal behavior by individuals, not
by restricting technology.

  "It's completely proper that we  make it clear that what we thought of
as a prank  isn't a game  anymore,"  said Jude Franklin,  a senior  vice
president for  technology at  Planning  Research Corp.   But finding the
source of viruses can be difficult.  "There are going to be problems en-
forcing it because third parties aren't aware they're carrying them," he
said.

  Hearings are expected in June.

  The Morris  sentencing also  is likely  to dislodge  two similar bills
awaiting action on  the House side.   HR 55 and 287,  sponsored by  Rep.
Wally Herger (R-Calif.) and Rep Tom McMillen (D-Md.) respectively,  were
on hold in the House Judiciary Committee pending comments from Justice.

                                                           -- UNQUOTE --

A couple of private points:

(1) Does anyone have a copy of S2476 and the time to key it in?

(2) Re: "Leahy's bill ... expands what might be considered a virus."
    Tomatoes are VEGETABLES by an Act of Congress, never mind the fact
    that biologically they're FRUIT.  (It has to do with tariffs; don't
    sweat it.)  This _MIGHT_ settle the worm/virus/pest/phage/whoosis
    etymology at least as far as the courts are concerned.  The Great
    Unwashed does _NOT_ care about the minutiae of technical terms.
    (And just to shut down some flames:  Yes, thank you, I _DID_
    recently pull jury duty -- and my faith in the good intentions
    of my fellow citizens was amply validated.)  The rest of us can
    still do our morphology and verbifying _off_ the witness stand.
