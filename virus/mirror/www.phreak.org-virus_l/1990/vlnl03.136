VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Paul,
          Most virus scanning software does simple pattern matching
of an existing 'known-virus' database against any files that you 'scan'.
If you have a list of viruses for the machine in question, it shouldn't
matter what platform you do the actual scan on. I have successfully
used a product called CERTUS in the exact manner that you described in
your letter. I simply defined a database for each platform and then
did the comparisons with the appropriate database based on the software
extension.

          I think back to a wonderful little nasty from the CP/M
days. There was a version of MODEM7 floating around that had a patch
in it that caused it to do all sorts of neat things when certain
character sequences were received over the async channel. One of these
nasty things was to take a character string coming in over the modem
and patch it into the bios at a jump vector specified in the incoming
string. I'm sure this was probably intended to allow someone to do
something useful such as replace I/O drivers on the fly for things
like remote tty services or other form of redirection. But, if you had
a nasty streak and you knew about this 'backdoor', imagine the damage
you could have done. (btw: it did this patching with no notification
to the user of the 'patched' machine). This was actually one of the
slickest little routines I ever saw in the CP/M 'virus/trojan' category
and it has caused me to run all of my comm programs through a datagram
analyzer while I'm 'breaking them in'. Especially if they are 'special'
purpose comm programs or if they require passwords to be automatically
sent by the package rather than manually entered by the user. As for
other networks....I can't think of a network that HASN'T come under attack
in one way or another. Magnetic induction? Hmmmm...I don't think the
technology is advanced enough to permit a focused field of the precision
required to affect a machine (selectively altering bits that is) from
an external source. Of course a good magnetic 'bulk eraser' provides a
quick method of simplifying your file management :)

You may not be aware that mac floppies have software and hardware
locking.  I don't know how to set or unset the software lock on
floppies, but Virus Blockade has an option to do this.

Subject: Stoned Remover (PC)

The stoned is a troublesome virus because it infects the hard disk
partition table. If left on the hard disk, it will eventually corrupt
the FAT (this is due to compatability problems and was not intended by
the author of the virus). Here is a short assembler program to remove
it from the hard disk. It can be assem- bled through DEBUG

DEBUG
- -A
MOV DX,80    ; THE HARD DISK, HEAD 0
MOV DX,7     ; CLUSTER 0, SECTOR 7
MOV BX,200   ; MEMORY LOCATION 200
MOV AX,201   ; READ FROM HARD DISK TO MEMORY
INT 13       ; DISK ACCESS
MOV CX,1     ; CLUSTER 0, SECTOR 1 (THE PARTITION TABLE)
MOV AX,301   ; WRITE FROM MEMORY TO HARD DISK
INT 13       ; DISK ACCESS
MOV AH,0     ; RESET AH REGISTER
INT 21       ; TERMINATE

N STONEDHD.COM
RCX
:30
W
Q

Only use this on hard drives that are infected. It will destroy the
partition table on uninfected drives.

This program will remove it from drive A:

DEBUG
A
MOV DX,100  ; HEAD 1, DRIVE A:
MOV CX,3    ; CLUSTER 0 SECTOR 3
MOV BX,200  ; MEMORY LOCATION 200
MOV AX,201  ; READ FROM DISK TO MEMORY
INT 13      ; DISK ACCESS
MOV DX,0    ; HEAD 0 DRIVE A:
MOV CX,1    ; CLUSTER 0, SECTOR 1 ( THE BOOT RECORD)
MOV AX,301  ; WRITE FROM MEMORY TO DISK
MOV AH,0    ; RESET AH REGISTER
INT 21      ; END

N STONEDA.COM
RCX
:30
W
Q

This will remove it from drive A:
To do a lot of disks, try this
Put an uninfected disk in A:
DEBUG
L 0 0 0 1
Put an infected disk in A:
W 0 0 0 1
Put another infected disk in A:
W
Repeat as often as necessary

If you have any mor questions or need any more help, drop me a

Subject: Back issues now available in indexed/digested format

                          A long time ago,
                    from a computer far far away,
                 VIRUS-L was unmoderated and undigested.

Sorry...  Bad attempt at humor.  Anyway, as I was saying, V-L existed
in a very different form from the day that it was started (April 22,
1988) until shortly after the Internet worm of November 1988.
Previously, all of the pre-digest traffic has been available on both
Lehigh's LISTSERV machine (LEHIIBM1 from BITNET or IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
from Internet) and the CERT ftp machine (cert.sei.cmu.edu) in the form
of weekly logs.  Anthony Appleyard,
XPUM04@prime-a.central-services.umist.ac.uk, has graciously (and
painstakingly) compiled these weekly logs into digests.  The digests
make up volume 0 and are now available for anonymous FTP on
cert.sei.cmu.edu in the pub/virus-l/archives/predig.digested
directory.  The information in volume 0 is somewhat dated, of course,
but can provide some interesting insight into current virus events
(and perhaps a laugh or two - things have changed a bit...).

Also included in all of this is an index to volume 0.  That, too, is
on the CERT anonymous FTP machine, in the pub/virus-l/archives
directory.

A wholehearted thanks to Anthony for his effort on putting together
all of this traffic!

Cheers,

Subject: Site licenses

We have been thinking about standardizing on a virus
scanner/disinfector for our organization. We have about 1500 users.

Our vision is to have a scanner/disinfector package available
to the PC support analysts and have them use it on suspicious
machines or perform random audits.

I have been thinking about purchasing a Service Industry
License from McAfee Associates. The total package would cost
about $6800.00 for (20 copies). This license would allow us
to perform checks on various machines, however, the software
must not remain with the clients.

Has anyone one else in the corporate arena implemented such a
policy/structure?

This is a forward from Aryeh Goretsky of the Computer Virus
Industry Association:
================================================================

Note:  Contact information from the following CVIA Membership Alert
has been removed from the posting, but has been submitted
separately to the Virus-L moderator.

July 31, 1990
CVIA Membership Alert
Originating Member: [Information Removed]
Alert Type: Initial Infection Spread
Library Entry: Joshi-B
Entry Type: Boot Sector & Partition Table / "Stealth" Virus

          The Joshi virus has been reported and verified on July 30 on
a number of workstations in a local area network in North Carolina,
marking the first incident of the virus reported to the CVIA in the
South-Central U.S.  A variant of Joshi was also reported and
verified on July 31 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  It has been named the
Joshi-B.  This variant causes destruction of the Partition Record
and boot sector of hard disks, as well as the virus' normal
interference with floppy diskette use.
          The virus is a "stealth" Boot sector and Partition Table virus
and thus is very difficult to identify on an already infected
system.  It is becoming widely dispersed in the U.S. and is likely
to become one of the more common viruses, based on its past
performance and speed of replication.
          A remover for the virus is available through your CVIA contact
person.

Subject: Periodic virus sighting report

The following new virus infections were reported recently:

- - First sighting of Slow (PC) virus reported in Australia.  Major
  infection path so far seems to be Taiwan -> Hong Kong -> Phillipines
  -> Malaysia -> New Zealand -> Australia.

- - Joshi (PC) virus reported in Lakeland Florida area.

- - 4096 (PC) virus reported in Spokane/Seattle Washington area.
  Several sites hit.

These sightings were reported to me; they are in addition to the other
reports that have appeared on VALERT-L and/or VIRUS-L.  When possible,
I have phoned at least one contact in the area to verify the
sightings.
