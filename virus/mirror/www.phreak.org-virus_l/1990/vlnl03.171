Certain programs that depend on knowing the password won't run, but the
machine is not unusable.

I think that indirectly I am responsible for this one.  Many months ago,
I posted a message dealing with the possiblities of fonts, PS programs
etc. etc. that could be destructive.  What I basically said, was that it
was quite possible for a font (since it is a program) or any other PS
program to do nasty things, like delete fonts from a hard disk (if your
printer supports a hard disk), reset the password on the printer, etc. etc.

I still know of no instance where any of this has ACTUALLY happened, tho
I have had several people contact me, and ask for help resurecting thier
lasers.  I posted a routine a couple of months ago on this group that
would enable the reading of the password, regardless of what it was, so
that it could be reset.  For a long time, I have offered a routine to
people who requested it  on department letterhead (official stationary)
that allows the alteration of ANY byte in the EEPROM.  It has the potential
to do a lot of damage.  Eventualy, someone over in UK pointed out that
all one really had to do was to read the actual password, and then they
could reset it correctly.  He published a bit of code, and subsequently
I modified my routines so that they return a map of the eeprom (a dump)
and return the current password.  You can then change it using the normal
Postscript operators.

Ken was reluctant to publish the stuff (it was a CEXEC routine, because
it was a binary, but made the exception one time.  I believe it should
be available in the digests).  I am not going to post it again to this
group out of respect to Ken's opinions.  Since it went out once, it is
in the archives.  It has been posted in the Postcript group as well.

Once again, while it is quite possible that some clip-art or font
could be booby trapped with the machine language routine that allows
unlimited writing to the eeprom, and thus could reset the printer
password etc, etc.  I have not really had any verification of it
actually happening.  I do know of one individual that did some
experimentation in a controlled enviornment, and reported that indeed
it could be done.(this was in a private email message).  This
particular individual is above reproach, and certainly hasn't allowed
what he did, out of his hands.  At anyrate it was not a
self-replicating thing, just a simple trojan, to determine if the
threat was real. He subsequently sent me a nifty "vaccine" for the
problem, that Glenn Ried subsequently made a minor and useful
modification to.

In postscript you can re-define the operators.  The "vaccine" simply
redifines the setpassword operator to do nothing.  This won't stop the
machine language routine, but is rather effective for preventing
casual changes to the password.  The default password is 0, as is
widely known, and if it is known, then it can be changed.  If not, it
cannot be changed through normal postcript commands.  Here is a simple
"vaccine"

/setpassword
	{
	/Helvetica findfont 20 scalefont setfont % create a font
	100 100 moveto (Someone is trying to reset your password) show
	pop pop	%remove the to setpassword parameters
	showpage
	} bind def

Hello,
   I would like information regarding a possible virus.  On one of
our machines we have a file called DDATE.COM (512 bytes, 11-01-88
creation date).  This program displays the message "WHO YOU GONNA
CALL? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!"  This is only displayed when the date is
set at certain times.
   Does this sound like any known virus?  Please respond via E-Mail.

Subject: Possible virus artifact in DR-DOS v5?

I have recently upgraded my 25MHz 386 with ST4096 to DR-DOS v5.  My
site is (touch wood!) relatively safe from viral attack, so when
McAfee's SCAN reported the STONED virus, I looked VERY carefully at
what was going on.

The symptoms were:

1) scan v54 & v67 reported Stoned in the partition table.
2) scan v54 & v67 did not find Stoned in memory - EVEN AFTER REBOOTING
3) no floppy that had been in this machine for the previous +- 2 days
     had been infected.
4) clean v67 agreed to clean out the virus, and did - scan reports all clear.
5) no damage whatsoever, and no messages from the virus.

Has anyone seen this before? Is there a dead virus sitting in some
code here?  Am I going to get jumped on by a new kind of virus?

I would appreciate any comments....

This guy seems to have been quite busy!  I got a similar message, but from
a different account name:

   Greetings from Ontario!

   A couple of months ago you mentioned having experienced an outbreak of
   Yankee Doodle virus.  Do you still need help with this?  If so, I would
   be more than happy to send any and all info I have concerning this
   virus, ....
   Also, if you could send us a specimen for research purposes ....

The account name used in this attempt was "Matthew D. Harding"
(rose.waterloo.edu!mdharding>.  I wondered why someone who alleged to have
a good knowledge on ways to stop the YD virus would want a copy, but unlike
Dean Davidson, didn't ever follow up (but neither did I reply to Sheffer).

It is evident that we have to be alert to this sort of abuse of the network.
I am very concerned about this sort of thing because Usenet is a sensitive
issue around here (a security conscious organization).

I have run a PC lab "virus free" for the last three years. We use a
Novel network, with student PCs equiped with auto-bootup ROMS on the
network cards. The students cannot write to the server hard disk, only
access applications and data. The student PCs do not have hard disks.
No floppies are handed out by staff. Students can download shareware
and licensed software.  They cannot make a DOS diskette. We also run
the McAlfee program (WE ARE LICENSED FOR IT!) A student can check a
floppy for possible infection.

We recently won a NACUBO cost reduction incentive award for this Lab.
We have stayed virus free. Other labs in this school have been
clobered repeatedly. I don't know how you could enforce a perimeter
defense.  Do you intend to screen every floppy comming in the door?
Pretty labor intensive, as well as annoying to customers. Run memory
resident virus checking programs? Those TSRs may interfer with other
applications.

This appears to be the case, although our own testing is no finished yet.

In any event, I would suggest that people, in New Zealand at least, no
longer use KILLER to treat the Stoned virus. We have released a new
program, NOSTONE, which handles both the original Stoned and a new
variant with an altered signature (and one of several new messages,
including "Donald Duck is a liar.") Recent versions (post 64) of
McAfee's SCAN also know about both versions of the Stoned virus.

NOSTONE is available on our publicly distributed collection of
anti-virus utilities and it will be available for anonymous FTP very
shortly; like wait a day or two. The files will be in /usr/local/ftp
on rata.vuw.ac.nz

Subject: Avoiding anti-viral inits (Mac)

I've been working as a disk repair person for my college's computing
services center, and I've noticed something interesting: When I am
copying (MacTools) or repairing (Norton Utilities) a disk, the Virex
Init will not ask me if I want to scan the disk for viruses, at least
not at first.  Once Norton has --oops, backup.  This only happens if
the disk is damaged and has no working desktop.  Once Norton has
rebuilt the desktop, Virex pops up (while Norton is running--this
really surprised me the first time it happened) to see about scanning
for viruses.  My question is, can a virus spread from a disk when the
desktop is inactive, or when another program is working on the disk,
either copying, bit-editing, repairing, or what-have-you.  I know that
Norton will find viruses while repairing (very impressive!), but what
about other programs?

Subject: Ohio Virus/Postscript trojan

first about ohio virus

	it is a boot sector virus - lives only on 5.25 floppies.
Easily removed. Skulason's F-prot will do it and so will Mcaffee's
MDISK. What we did at Ohio state (not the home, but the discovery
point of this virus) was simply to recopy all infected application
disks in our labs. If a disk is bootable you can do even less work.
Boot with a clean copy of the version of dos on the infected disk.
Assuming dos disk in A: and infected disk in B:, at A> type SYS B: The
hidden dos files and the boot sector will be overwritten.

     We then made sure all disks that could be write protected were.
This virus and the brain virus were found at the same time. By being
very strict about write protects (and even using notchless disks as
much as we can) we have no trouble with viruses on our floppies now.
     For hard disks we licensed Skulason's F-prot. Very nice,  very cheap.

   About postscript trojan. Nobody seems to know its name or any
details, but this was all hashed out here a few weeks ago. Also, I
seem to have been hit by it.
	Contrary to published reports (national mac magazines) no
hardware replacements are needed. There are FREE software fixes for
this. You are supposed to need to know the password to chnage the
password but the security has holes. The fix was posted to comp.virus.
	By the way changeing the password is a bad idea. I have never
tried this on true post script pinter (our affected machine was a
Kyocera clone) but when it's password was change (by trojan or vandel)
it could not be printed to by such applications as Pagemaker and
Microsoft Word. The passord is not just for administrative functions -
at least not on Kyocera.

	Unfortunately, the published fix would not work on this
postscript clone, but only on true postscript. After many phone calls
and help from Woody Baker & Zbigniew Fiedorowicz a fix was eventually
found. Amazingly the company that made it finaaly understood the
problem and found someone who knew how to fix it.

	Apple charges $600 I think to fix this. Apple loves to rip off
customers. Apologies to them if they have never charged this.

If you rebooted with Ctrl-Alt-Del, you may still have a resident
virus.  Maybe it wasn't M-J complaining about the write protect, but
DOS due to a virus trying to infect your disk.  Try powering up the
system with a known clean boot diskette and run your virus-removing
programs again.

Subject: About "Stoned" - variants and removal

I was wondering if anyone could clarify the situation with MacAfee's SCAN
regarding [Stoned] and its variants, please.

In the VIRLIST.TXT the original 'Stoned' is marked as 'Use CLEANUP' to
remove, while 'Stoned II' is marked as 'Use MDISK'.  The identifier which
SCAN is supposed to report is [Stoned] for both of them, so how do you
know which one you have, and which cleanup to use.

The computers at the hospital where I study (which does have a site licence)
have been infected with [Stoned] and CLEANP66 has worked, but I looked at
the boot sector of a floppy and it had the message "Your PC is now stoned,
LEGALISEd"  with no mention of Marijuana.  Is this a strain which overwrote
the message with some extra code, or what?  Which 'Stoned' do we have?

MacAfee warns against loss of partition table data and total disk corruption
when using CLEAN to remove 'Stoned' on non-standard machines.  Would making
CLEAN insist on putting a copy of the (infected) partition table in a file
on a floppy disk remove the trauma of getting rid of this virus?  If a hard
disk were rendered unusable by CLEAN, it could be 'UNCLEANED', restoring
the partition table to a usable form so the poor user could be given a
second chance to back up before doing a low-level format.

In any case, thank you, Mr MacAfee, for reducing the extra work which virus-
writers have heaped upon us.

Greetings From Spain

Have somebody heard something about an antivirus program called PC-Cilling?
A friend of mine purchased a copy, and stoned get into the system, althoug
the program claimed for something called 'hardware security' (in fact a
- -I think- hardware protection for the program). the program has been imported
to Spain from California, USA.

Apple is providing a utility on AppleLink that will make the fix.  Use
string"LaserWriter and Trojan Horse" to search in Technical info
library.
