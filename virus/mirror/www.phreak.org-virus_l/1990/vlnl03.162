VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

This is not a virus.  The program is California Games by Epyx.  The
messages are part of the program.  Do not worry.

Subject: Jerusalem B (PC) reinfection despite using VSHIELD?

Last week I discovered the Jerusalem B virus on one of our PCs.  It
had only infected 7 files (around 30 times).  I had run SCAN on that
system on Aug 13th, so it arrived after that.  I didn't find it on
either of the other PC's, eliminated it from the infected system, and
installed VSHIELD on all three PCs.

The following afternoon, my assistant copied SCAN and CLEAN to a
diskette that had previously been used only for transferring data
files between PCs.  After the 'copy' commands were done, he SCANned
the diskette, and it had Jerusalem B on it.  The copy was done from a
system supposedly protected with VSHIELD.

The system from which the copies were made is clean, according to SCAN.

Can Jerusalem B infect data files, or is there something else on a 3
1/2 inch floppy that can contain Jerusalem B?  At this point, the
infected diskette contains only the 4 files that were copied to it
last Thursday.

Dan, I have been testing FPROT on a Bull 386SX with no problems.  I am
surprised that you have had problems with F-DRIVER.SYS - I have had
none.  Is it possible that this problem may be a conflict with any of
the software you are running?  Especially, check any T&SR software.

As for the boot sector problem - writing to the boot sector regularly
is BAD practise along with executables that modify themselves!  There
is nothing you can do about this apart from complain to the
manufacturers!

Subject: Thanks for the help (Mac)

Thanks everybody for the help and suggestions. It seems that a
combination of upgrading to System 6.0.3 and rebuilding the desktop
took care of the problems. The overt problems, that is... I'm hoping
there isn't anything else there. (fingers crossed)
  Particular thanks for the (two) copies of Disinfectant 2.1; as soon
as I can get it transferred from my PC to a Mac I can even use it...
<grin>

Subject: Re: Viruses in Sound Effects (Mac)

Look, this whole discussion of nVIR in sound files is bogus. nVIR and
its variants can only *infect* applications (including Finder and DA
Handler) and the system file. Of course, it can *affect* anything.

The assertion that you should check everything is fairly decent advice
for beginners, but there are definitely many types of files that will
remain forever uninfectable. (That is, with a healthy contagious
virus.) In general, these are data files which don't contain
information which is interpreted as anything like instruction
sequences by a fairly generic command processor.  Yes, I know that
that's a pretty vague definition, but it's pretty accurate too for all
of that.

Note that this definition pretty much rules out ever having a complete
active virus in a sound file (in the formats which we generally use.
If someone were to invent a sound format that, like TrueType for
example, were to consist of data and instructions, that might just
possibly be excepted).

I wonder about how close a "command processor" has to be to a turing
machine in order to be ably to spread infectious code. Some
requirements are obvious, some are not.

Interestingly enough, this definition allows for viruses in english
text.  Of course, those viruses infect humans. Specifically, their
brains.  (Mention "memes" in sci.nanotech if you want to get flooded
with info about this...)

A Short Course on Computer Viruses      (a book review) by Jon David
- ----------------------------------

Dr. Frederick B. Cohen has just come out with a new book, A Short
Course on Computer Viruses. It is not by far the first book on
computer viruses, and it will certainly not be the last. Atypically,
though, it is one of particular worthiness.

Dr. Cohen is referred to as "the father of the virus." While he did
not create the virus, he published much original work on viruses in
the early '80s, most of it theoretical, or at least heavily
mathematically based. This work was originally relegated to academic
circles, but has since become the heart of the set of classic virus
literature. Further, Dr. Cohen has since taken his virus
investigations out of the lab and applied them to the real world.

For companies and individuals recognizing the need to understand
viruses before attempting to treat them, Dr. Cohen offers a full day
course on computer viruses. (And, by the way, not just PC viruses; it
also treats mainframe viruses, network viruses, etc.) This book, while
not a word-for-word transcription of this course, seems a fairly close
approximation. (Although I have not attended Dr. Cohen's course, I
have heard him speak on several occasions, and the book is true to
those presentations wherever the topics coincide.)

The book is written with a wry sense of humor throughout (and it is
important to know this, otherwise you might find some things set forth
a bit outrageous). This makes reading it, if not enjoyable, at least a
lot more enjoyable than other virus texts.

It covers everything from what viruses are and how they impact
information systems, through present defenses and future directions. I
found the sections on peer network problems and exposure analysis
particularly worthwhile.  The examples given are clear and ideal
answers to the "But why to you say that?" questions my customers
always ask when I create security and anti-virus methodologies for
them.

In the course of treating viruses, Dr. Cohen explains the differences
between sound defenses and solid defenses, between contamination
exposure and leakage exposure, between protection with your priority
being secrecy and it being integrity and the like. As you read this,
these may seem fine points, of interest only to students of security
(they apply, by the way, to all security, not just virus protection),
but let me assure you (and as you will find out by reading the book),
this is not the case, and understanding these things will make you a
better and more intelligent computer user.

In all honesty, the vast majority of readers will have trouble with
some parts of the book. The first chapter, for example, uses quite a
bit of mathematical "English" (user U-sub-1 evokes program P-sub-1
infected with virus V-sub-1 at time T-sub-1, etc.), and the fantastic
chapter on exposure analysis is quite heavily mathematical in parts.
Be assured, though, that missing some of the fine points of some
sections does not take away from the tremendous value of the rest of
the book.

A Short Course on Computer Viruses should be MUST reading for everyone
impacted by viruses or any other facet of information security (and
this is not just security leaders, or even controllers, auditors and
the like, but includes virtually every computer user).

Dr. Cohen's book is 196 pages (including a 5-page table of contents, a
3-page "Good Joke" and an outstanding 14-page annotated bibliography),
is available from

     ASP Press
     PO Box 81270
     Pittsburgh, PA 15217

and sells for $48.00 (single quantity, including postage & handling,
and with significant volume discounts available).  (ASP Press takes
checks or money orders, not credit cards.)
