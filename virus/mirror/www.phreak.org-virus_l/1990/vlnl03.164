Actually Paul, you are wrong.  It is the finder that is responsible
for displaying icons.  Macintosh files have 2 forks, a data fork, and
a resource fork.  Only a resource fork can have executable machine
code.  Each macintosh file also has 2 four byte fields, called the
Type and Creator.  All applications have type 'APPL'.  The finder uses
these fields to determine what icon to display for a file, and whether
a file is executable. Data files generally do not have a resource
fork.

This is incorrect. Display of icons is done by the Finder. The icons
themselves come from a special resource file known as the Desktop,
which is built incrementally as new files are written onto the disk.
Icons are added to this file only when the new file contains what is
known as a "bundle", a set of resources which map file types and
creators to icons. You can see this happen by copying a document for
which you do not have the application onto a disk. The document will
show up as the "generic document" (the dog-eared page icon). When the
application to which the file belongs is added to the disk, the
document will acquire its proper icon (the window in which it lives
must be closed and reopened for this to happen).

You may have been confused by the description of some of the Mac
viruses such as WDEF and CDEF. These viruses essentially override
the "standard" resources of the same type, and add their virus
code on top.

Subject: Review the Literature

	For those needing to build a knowledge base on MS-DOS based PC
viruses, the best place to start is Patricia Hoffman's excellent (am
biased) VSUM list (I believe VSUM9008 is the most current but VSUM9010
may be out next week - no 9009). 295k of ASCII text, it is the most
exhaustive listing I know of with information on origins, symptoms,
dates, effects, and commentary. It is at most of the Virus-L archives
or from HOMEBASE (408)988-4004.

	Meanwhile, will be at the Omni next week & still wonder where
the party is. (Have a D&P show though).

Subject: New Virus Strain (Mac)

For SAM 2.0 Users:

A new virus has been discovered in France. It is a strain of the ANTI
virus, and was named ANTI-ANGE by its discoverer. It is very similar
to ANTI. It attacks only applications, and generally exhibits the same
behaviour as ANTI.  It has certain bugs (which the previous ANTI does
not have) which can cause applications to crash once infected.

If you are using SAM 2.0 and have configured SAM Intercept in the
Standard, Advanced, or Custom levels, then SAM will alert you when
ANTI-ANGE attempts to change an application's code. Denying this
attempt keeps ANTI from spreading.

Using Virus Clinic you may also add a new virus definition to identify
this virus by name. The fields for the virus definition are:

   Virus Name: ANTI
Resource Type: CODE
  Resource ID: 1
Resource Size: Any
Search String: 000A317CFFFF000CA033303C0997A146     (hexadecimal)
Search Offset: Any   (or, for later versions of SAM, -886 will also work)

No.  Icons consist of 32x32 bitmaps.  An icon may be displayed for a
file which has no resources at all, only data (for example, a plain
text file.)  Icons are displayed by the Finder, using a desktop
database which ties a specific file type and file creator to a
specific icon.  No code is taken from the file itself.

For more information, read "The Finder Interface," chapter 1 of Inside
Macintosh, volume III.

Subject: Re: Help, I may have a virus (Virus-L, V#3, #161) (PC)

         In Virus-L, V#3, #161, James Bracher raises a question on CMOS
         loss upon bootup in his "Help, I may have a virus (PC)".  Mr
         Bracher is concerned he may have a virus in his computer's hard
         disk.

         Another reader raised the possibility of a weak battery due to
         aging.  I had that problem here last week where a computer lost
         its date (went back to the default of 1-1-80), but didn't lose
         the rest of the configuration when power was lost.  It turned
         out the battery was only holding/putting out 4 volts which the
         technician told me was too low this particular CPU.

         Another possibility could be a bad power supply.  We had a
         computer here that did everything from display RAM error
         messages, "No operating system found" messages, fail to boot,
         lose configuration, etc.  After hours of troubleshooting, we
         were coming up with nothing but frustration.  The technician and
         I talked about this computer's frequent maintenance problems.
         It then dawned on both of us this particular CPU had been in the
         same room where another CPU lost its hard disk, power supply and
         part of the motherboard to a power surge of some sort.  A meter
         check on the power supply showed it putting out only 7 volts
         when 12.5 was called for by the manufacturer.

         (don't quote me on the voltage figures---I got them second hand,
         but you get the general idea).

         Moral: When the box is acting weird, check the battery and power
         supply if everything else seems okay.

Yes and no.

No.  A file requires no executable code to get its icon displayed on a
Mac screen.  If a file leaves the right data structures in its
"resource fork" the Mac system will read those "resources", and
display the correct icon for the file.

Yes.  This is an avenue for infection.  The resource fork is a very
general purpose part of the Macintosh architecture.  There are many
different kinds of resources, and programmers can make up there own.
Of these different resources, many are executable resources.  When the
Finder (the name of the Mac's "shell" program.) needs to display a
window, it asks for the correct window definition, or "WDEF",
resource.

The WDEF virus hides in the desktop file, the place Finder looks for
icons.  If the Finder is looking in the desktop file and also needs to
display a window, it will use the WDEF code to do it, and it will be
tricked by the "implied loader" WDEF in the infected desktop file.

The Mac is different from others computers in many ways, but I think
it is safe to say that no matter what, a virus needs to get *some*
executable code run to actively do anything.

That doesn't mean that the code has be somewhere we expected to find
it, and it doesn't mean that the virus must run to spread.  It might
find some extra space in a data structure which gets copied in the
normal course of events.  To become alive, it will have to be run at
some point, but it might spread while dormant.

Back to the question of a virus hiding in a Macintosh sound:

First, the virus might somehow be on the disk which holds the sound.
WDEF is perfectly happy to spread this way.

Second, Mac sounds don't have to be just raw digitized bits, they can
contain "instructions" of a sort.  I have not studied them very
carefully, so I don't know whether they are powerful enough to
support a virus.

To be powerfull enough, I think they must be equivalent a Turing
machine and they need access to the outside world.

Anyone know a lot about Format 1 "snd " and "snth" resources?

Subject: Infection management and privacy

This is a selection of project ideas I prepared for our students.

3) Infection management and privacy

There have been several attempts in recent years to develop concepts
of infection management applicable to both electronic and biologic
agents. These have for the most part been definitional (e. g., safe
"HEX" vs. safe sex).  Analysis of epidemics as social phenomenon, that
include risk management and privacy dimensions, is one way to get
meaningful integration and useful cross-fertilization of approaches
and techniques.

Infection management has acquired a new domain with the growth of
computer networks and their now demonstrated vulnerability to
"viruses" (McAfee, 1989) and "worms" (Spafford, 1989). Infectious
disease continues to be a priority area in health care and is a major
initiative area in health care research in Denmark. Mann (1990)
suggests that a new AIDS like pandemic could occur unless some new
approach is taken to manage infectious agents. Law suits may force
health care organizations to adopt new methods for protection of
persons from infection, even before infectious agents have been
identified (Reuters, 1990).  Particularly with the growth of the AIDS
problem, the questions of privacy and individual integrity have
assumed new importance. These developments suggest a move toward
information intensive management strategies. Stodolsky (1989a, 1990)
describes a way to use distributed databases and cryptographic methods
to manage epidemics without compromising individual privacy. Stodolsky
(1989b) describes how a related approach could be used to control the
spread of infections on networks. The same theoretical models can be
applied to control of infection in the blood supply (Stodolsky, 1987),
to the spread of "inside" information on stock markets, and to the
management of sensitive information in a variety of other settings.

The number of reports of infections of computer systems has reached a
level where they cannot be coped with manually.  Some automated way of
sorting and processing these reports (and taking appropriate emergency
actions) is needed.  It is likely that experience gained in control of
infections on networks could be applied to human populations in the
future, as personal computers become widespread.

While truly secure systems require distributed database technology,
valuable experience could be gained with centralized systems. For
instance, a matchmaking (kontakt formidling) system using a voice
message - telephone interface could be used to build up records
permitting the tracing of chains of sexually transmitted infections
(Stodolsky, 1989a). Several matchmaking systems are currently
operating on the Internet, but their implementation make them
inappropriate for the functions considered here.

Project ideas:

3.1.	Systemic control of infections on computer networks
3.2.	Development of a group "calendar" (appointment diary) system
3.3.	Using conditional privacy in screening telephone calls
3.4.	Using conditional privacy in meeting management
3.5.	Voice message simulation of distributed epidemiological control
3.6.	Network matchmaker for infection control
3.7.	Software for democratic drug trials
