That's wrong, I'm afraid.  The Stoned virus infects the master boot
sector of the hard disk (the sector that contains the partition
table).  The DOS command "SYS" doesn't touch that sector, it only
restores the DOS (or "system") boot sector.  Removing the Stoned
requires a low-level format, or the use of some program that fixes the
master boot sector (unlike SYS).  (SYS generally -will- remove the
Stoned from -floppies-, because they have only one boot sector, and
SYS fixes it; but SYS doesn't remove the Stoned from hard disks.)

FACTS REGARDING THE PING PONG VIRUS INFECTION OF MARCH 1990

History -------------------------------

     The PC virus I received is known as the Ping Pong-B Virus.
It is also known as the Bouncing Ball, the Bouncing Dot, the
Italian, the Vera Cruz, the Falling Letters, and the Boot Virus.
     The original Ping Pong Virus is a boot sector virus first
reported in March 1988.  The original virus could only infect
floppy diskettes.
     The virus found at my company is a derivative of the
original Ping Pong Virus called Ping Pong-B.  The Ping Pong-B
Virus has the ability to infect fixed disk drives as well as
floppy diskettes. The virus is a resident boot sector infector,
meaning that the virus overwrites part of the disk boot sector
with a copy of itself and when RAM resident, occupies the high
end of active RAM.  The virus hasn't been reported to damage or
corrupt stored files.

What it did ---------------------------

     The virus becomes RAM resident when booted from an infected
drive.  The use of "CHKDSK.COM" shows that exactly 2048 bytes have
been taken from total memory available.  When the virus is booted
from an infected diskette, it immediately infects the other disk
drives without the user having to access them through DOS.  The
virus will overwrite the boot sector at sector 0, track 0, head 1,
offset 37.  The virus will also write to the first available
cluster on the data portion of the disk and mark it as bad.  This
particular feature of the virus doesn't seem to be documented.  I
would like to find out whether this so-called bad sector is a
duplicate of the virus or possible a data segment that the virus
uses.

Detection -----------------------------

     The active monitor program reported no virus activity because
most of the virus activity occurred during boot up, before the
active monitor program could be loaded and executed from DOS.
     The virus cannot stay memory resident when the computer is
turned off and booted from a clean system disk.  The virus is
destroyed when the DOS "SYS.COM" is used to overwrite the boot
sector of the infected disk.  The disk sector the virus marked
"bad" was rewritten to be usable by DOS and the information
contained in it was zeroed out three times.

Equipment -----------------------------

     The virus was examined on a Panasonic FT-70 portable personal
computer.  The FT-70 is an IBM XT compatible featuring 640K of RAM
using an Intel 8086 microprocessor.  The FT-70 does not feature a
fixed disk drive.  All disks used in the examination of this virus
were magnetized after use, to prevent further contamination.

I am previewing a paper by Peter Tippett, M.D., Ph.D., which deals
with this issue.  Dr. Tippett believes that the doubling time for
Jerusalem and Brain is about 2 months.  By his calculations, the
population of these viruses has not yet gotten "interesting."  He
believes that the growth curves exhibit marked knees in the 30-40
month time frame.  For example, if a virus were to reach a million
copies in month 36, it would see two million by month 38.

>Or will the increasing availability of virus scanning tools and

Dr. Tippett believes that everything that we have done to date is
factored into that doubling time.

There is no auto-immune function in computers.  An infected one will
remain infected and keep infecting others until intervention.
Computers do not die, they either remain in or rejoin the population.
(John McAfee asserts that a once infected computer runs a fifty-fifty
chance of being re-infected in ninety days.  While viruses replicate
only in computers, where they are not persistent, they reside and move
on floppies, where they are extremely peristent.

If Dr. Tippett is correct, we will soon stop dealing with computer
viruses on a clinical (case-by-case, system-by-system) basis and begin
to deal with it on an epidemiologic one.

Our PC got hit by Jerusalem B yesterday (via a customer's disk).  With the
aid of SCAN and CLEAN, we were able to eradicate the infection in both PCs
with little effort.  Thank you, John McAfee!!  Thank God for shareware.
The registration fee is well worth it.

Subject: Viruses and Copyrights (Part 3)

     Sorry for the delay in posting - final exams, you know.

    By copyrighting a work the author protects the following rights:

1) The exclusive right to make copies of the work.  This right is waived
   when viruses are involved since they self-replicate.

2) The exclusive right to prepare derivative works (works based on the
   original work).  This might also be waived for viruses since they
   attatch themselves to other programs, thus making derivative works
   of the virus.  Of course the infected program is now a derivative
   work of the program before it was infected, violating the copyright of
   that program's author(s).  With this in mind I'd say that true viruses
   are also illegal since they infringe copyrights in addition to all the
   other laws regarding illegal use of a computer, etc.

3) The exclusive right to perform the work (as in plays, music, etc.)
   This right doesn't apply to computer viruses, unless someone writes a
   really weird one!  :-)

4) The exclusive right to display the work in a commercial setting.
   Applicable only if the virus author wants to advertise and sell his
   'product.'  This would, of course, serve as evidence against him/her.

5) The exclusive right to market or distribute the work.  This also
   doesn't apply to viruses since they replicate (distribute) themselves.


     The above are the only 5 rights that are protected by copyright, at
least according to the book I have read.

     Next time, which will be my last posting on viruses and copyrights,
will discuss what constitutes a proper copyright notice.  The information
could surprise you!

DISCLAIMER:  As always, the above are my personal interpretations of
             _How to Copyright Software_ (3rd edition) by attorney

             advice, if there is such a thing.  ;-)

Subject: Stoned Virus Removal (PC)

          McAfee's CLEAN program will remove the Stoned virus as
mentioned in yesterday's posting.  However the DOS SYS command will
NOT remove the virus.  The virus infects the master boot record of
hard disks (Partition Table), and the SYS command does not alter this
area of the disk.  It WILL work on floppies, of course, provided they
are bootable floppies and there is room for the system info.

You should not take this recommendation seriously.  Low level formatting
is almost never necessary.  Most viruses only corrupt .EXE or .COM files,
which can usually be restored, by using a disinfection program. The only
viruses that cause problems are:

          Taiwan, which sometimes destroys the infected program instead
          of properly infecting it.

          Jerusalem, which occasionally corrupts a file while infecting,
          if the header contains incorrect information about the file length.
          I have only seen this twice, however - but one of the programs is
          very common (WordPerfect).

          Vienna (and the Lisbon variant), which destroys one out of every
          eight files it infects.

          405 and other overwriting viruses.

In those (rare) cases you are forced to restore the files from a backup copy,
but in all other cases disinfectors are available that will restore an
infected program to its original state.

With boot sectors the story is similar - formatting is not required.  In most
cases the original boot sector (or partition record) can be easily recovered,
with the exception of the Swap (Fallboot) virus.

When cleaning up after the Dark Avenger virus, it is strongly advised to
format the disk (an ordinary DOS format is all that is needed) and restore
all programs and data files from backups.  The reason is that the Dark Avenger
may have garbled some sectors on the disk and possibly destroyed data or
program files.  No disinfection tool is able to recover from this.

There is one virus that might require a low level format, though.  When the
Disk Killer virus activates, it starts encrypting the hard disk, including
the partition table.  DOS format can not handle this, you would need to run
FDISK first and possibly a low level formatting tool.  On the other hand,
it is possible to write a program to recover the original data, as the
encryption method is easily reversible.

     Just for everyones information SCAN and CLEAN are now at version
60.  Best way to ensure good copies are to DL them directly from
McAfee Associates BBS 408-988-4004. He also has the PKZIP programs

Subject: New Mac Virus?

I have started having problems with my Mac that I didn't have two days
ago.  I run a number of memory-resident programs which could have
started interacting in a funny way, but the facts lead me to be wary-

in a chronological order

a) Infrequently, when I run MacMail 0.5, I cannot type in id or password
information without generating an app(1? 2? 3? 4?)event, which is now
reserved for MultiFinder.  MacMail traps this and doesn't let me
continue.  The ID & PW window is the first one that pops up, so I can't
do anything other than quit... other apps work fine, but reruning
MacMail doesn't fix it.  Rebooting does.

I've had that problem long before the others, and MacMail is still in
the development stage, so it may have nothing to do with the "virus."

b) I run TeachText and try editing a 1.5 page document.  I can't
backspace over any line breaks without getting a System bomb #10.  Can't
clear or cut a selection containing a line break either, though copy
works.

I start up Appleshare, connect to my machine from a remote computer, and
start up TeachText remotely.  My system software should now be out of
the loop.  I try editing a different document.  Now I can't even
backspace over a single character.

I should point out these errors only occur while editing in or near the
last screenful.

c)  Today I turn on the computer, bootup goes fine until the file window
gets drawn.  The rectangle comes up with the title, but instead of
drawing the icons with titles, I get another System error #10.  Booting
up with a second disc works, but running software off my HD makes the
Mac try to change systems, and I end up with a sys err #2.

This could be Appleshare writing where it shouldn't be, or a corrupted
sector map (which forced me to reformat my HD a scant month ago), or
both- who knows?  It could also be a virus.

Tomorrow I'd like to binhex my system and teachtext, and mail them to an
expert who can tell me if there is any evidence of a virus.  I've sent
mail to Werner Uhrig, hope he can point me in the right direction.
