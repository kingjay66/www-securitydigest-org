VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

  We have recently been infected by "Stoned" as well.  I would much
  like to get a copy of the stoned information also.

  I agree.  I was already wondering if there was a list of "indications"
  which correspond to the various viruses already out there.

"IHS student unleashes computer viruses"

by Chris Swingle
Journal Staff

   A 16-year-old Ithaca High School student created computer viruses
that spread during the summer to dozens of Macintosh personal
computers in Ithaca, officials reported Monday.
   Computers at Ithaca High, BAKA Computers Inc. and Cornell
University were affected, but the problems are now believed solved.
The viruses took hundreds -- or even thousands -- of work hours to
fix, one official estimated.
   "It can be described as a nuisance," said Ted Palmer, a senior
investigator with the New York State Police in Cortland who
specializes in computer crime investigations.
   The Ithaca High School teenager, whose name wasn't released, isn't
being prosecuted because he cooperated and agreed to help police in
future investigations, Palmer said.
   Computer viruses are miniature programs that can replicate and
spread from one computer to another, much as microorganism do.  These
viruses can wreak havoc -- tying up computer's memory, interrupting
normal operations, causing errors or even destroying data.
   The IHS case comes almost two years after a Cornell University
graduate student drew national attention with a similar type of rogue
program called a "worm," which jammed some 6,000 government, military
and university computers.
   Robert T. Morris Jr. was convicted on federal charges of computer
tampering in January, and he was sentenced to 400 hours of community
service and fined $10,000.
   This summer's two local viruses, which additionally had variations,
didn't destroy any information, but did spread quickly from disk to
disk.  The virus "infected" a new computer by moving into the hard
disk core of the computer, then hopping onto the next disk that was
put in the computer.
   "All that was necessary is that a disk be inserted, to be
infected," said Mark Anbinder, a technical consultant for BAKA.  "So
it was a particularly annoying one."
   "I would describe it as serious in that it interferes with the
computers' operation," he added.
   One virus was first discovered in May, and another strain appeared
in August, Anbinder said.
   A police investigation started Aug. 22 and ended Sunday, Palmer
said.  State police and Cornell public safety investigators worked
with virus experts to analyze the computer bug and trace its origin.
   In the spring of 1988, Macintosh computers at Cornell were infected
by a virus called Scores that made the machines act increasingly
erratically, then stop working altogether.

It is my belief that any file on the mac which is capable of
displaying itself as an icon has executable code to do so.  If this is
true, then ANY file is open to infection by a virus designed to take
advantage of this.

Of course, it is very possible that I have been mis-informed and the
above premise is totally incorrect, in which case, I apologise in
advance.

Any comments from knowledgable mac users?

An out of control program can cause the c-mos info to get lost.  I have
seen it happen more often than I want to.

Interrupt driven code is especialy prone to wiping this out, however
It is sounding more and more like a marginal battery.  Perhaps you
should replace the battery.  Often times they start causing problems a
couple of years down the road.

This can also be caused by a bad battery.  I worked on a machine with
a faulty battery this summer and it configured itself differently
every day.  One result was refusing to format floppy disks.

[ maybe we should ask Cliff to write us his stories of "My Encounters with
  Journalists" ... ]

	the local PBS station has been hyping/announcing next week's
	program in the NOVA series as their first comedy-thriller,
	telling the story of Cliff Stoll, (by now) famous computer-spy
	hunter ...

	fire up those recorder's ...

	ah, someone else just posted more details on a local group:

PBS TV will be showing a NOVA program on the re-enactment Clifford
Stoll's (author of "The Cuckoo's Egg") efforts to catch a hacker
stealing data from military and research computers.  The program is
called "The KGB, the Computer and Me."  It is scheduled for Tuesday,
October 2nd at 8:00 pm EDT, check your local station listings for
exact time in your area.
