Re: Virus Trends

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Tracking Infections

The current flurry of WDEF infection reports has reawakened a long-standing
interest of mine in tracking the propagation of nasties (term intended to
include both virus and Trojan horse).  I know people will occasionally post
messages to this list along the lines of, "If anyone's keeping track of
infection reports...", but this seems to be rather sporadic and haphazard.

Question:  Who is collecting such information, and in what form?  I would
certainly be willing to offer my assistance in the collection effort, but
how much of this wheel has already been invented, and what remains to be
done?

Going one step further, what if we were to formalize the procedure of
reporting, at least for the academic sites, by enlisting "spotters" at
various institutions, who would then file a brief report on any infections
at their location?  Microcomputer coordinators and user-support staffers
would be likely candidates.  This is a suggestion for discussion, so I'd
welcome any feedback, positive or negative.

Can either of you shed some light on the above message?  It contains
serious contradictions with both itself and the statements of Mr.
McAfee with whom it purports to agree.

The comments about DES and public key encryption contained in the
above message are extremely confused.  All indication is that the AIDS
trojan does simple substitutions on file names.  The above message
claims that the entire disk is encrypted with a public key encryption
scheme.

My conclusion is that this message was not posted in good faith.  The
last thing anyone needs is this kind of purposeful misinformation.
This conclusion is supported by the claim that the so-called SWE
company has moved and "returned" their sample disks to the owners.

By associating yourselves with this nonsense, you have seriously impaired
your reputations.

Subject: Questions re VIRUS-L

I have two questions which the digest has probably dealt with but for
newcomers might be worth responding to again:

1.  Does the Digest provide a way to query the effectiveness of commercial
antivirus programs against known viruses? --e.g., a kind of table with
commercial (or other published programs) across the top and known viruses
down the side and an X at the intersection if the program handles it.  This
would be a real service.

2.  Does this Digest have a formal feedback mechanism to commercial and other
antivirus program developers, so that they get a sense of what needs to be
done and pronto?  Or do we know that they are all members of the listserv and
we leave it at that, depending on laissez-faire economics?

As a new reader I appreciate the service and the effort that goes into it.

[Ed. To answer 1., there have been various informal product reviews
sent in to the VIRUS-L digest by various readers (perhaps someone out
there has put them together in one doc?) as well as pointers to other
reviews (e.g., PC Mag).

The digest does not offer a formal feedback mechanism.  However,
numerous shareware and commercial anti-virus product vendors to
monitor and (in some cases) contribute to the digest.  Feedback sent
to the digest does reach them.]

As far as I understand, the DES formula is public, but exporting
impelemntations is prohibited in the USA. However there is
nothing preventing one to make a DES implementation outside the
USA and distributing it. Here in Helsinki University of
Technology Antti Louko has written one, it is available by
anonymous ftp from kampi.hut.fi (130.233.224.2), file is
alo/des-dist.tar.Z.

It was also posted to USENET comp.sources.??? group a while ago,
the posting was dove via a moderator in Australia, since
importing DES to the is legal by the US law. (Please note that
whatever the US government has to say about DES does not apply to
us outside the US territory, the most USA can do is to contact
our government or send a spy killer or invade Finland like they
did invade Panama.)

As to what this has to do with viruses, I don't know, but I think
that a public DES implementation might be interesting enough to
many people in the virus field, so maybe the moderator will be
nice and let this pass.

Oops!  Minor omission on my part.  I neglected to include in my
comment about the authors being well known that they should be easily
and widely reachable!

There is also the underlying presumption in my message that a new
release is confirmed from the author before publication of the

Subject: Comments Attributed to SWE

The following comments indicated by ">" were attributed to SWE in
VIRUS-L 1234.

>SWE first suspected and tested for the public key encryption method
>for several reasons. The major reason was the lack of access people
>outside of the United States would have to the DES encryption formula.

[The DEA is an encryption algorithm developed and licensed by IBM. The
DES is a U. S. Government standard for the implementation of that
algorithm.]

The DES is published and available from The Superintendent of
Documents, U.S.  Government Printing Office Washington, D.C.  It
can be implemented in software without much difficulty.  It is
widely available outside the U.  S.

>For those not aware, the U.S. Government guards the DES formula, and
>software which makes use of this formula may not be exported out of
>the United States. Should it turn out that the DES formula was also

>under United States statutes pertaining to national security.

While export of any munitions, including cryptography, from the U.S.
msut be licensed, possession or use of the DES or DES outside the U. S.
is not a crime.

>The second reason deals with the DES encryption method. Students of
>cryptology are well aware that the DES formula has been considered
>vulnerable for some time now.

Students of cryptology are aware of an untruth.  While there have
been flawed implementations of the DEA, the cheapest know attack
against the DES is an exhaustive attack against the key.
Such an attack is measured in centuries of 3090 time.

>It is also a well know fact that DES
>specific processors have been produced, which make "cracking" a DES
>encrypted file much easier than the public key method. The DES method
>also limits to a greater degree the length of the encryption key.

Have you seen one?  Do you even know anyone that has seen one?        (Of
course everyone knows someone who knows someone who has seen one, but
that is true of UFO's too.

As to the relative strength of the two method, each is, in part a
function of the key length chosen.  However, in general, public
key lengths of 8 to 10 times as long are required to achieve
comparable security with the DEA.

While the DES limits the length of the key to 56 bits, choice of
key length in an implementation is arbitrary.  IBM sells an
implementation that employs a 112 bit key, if only to protect other
keys.

>Combining these two reasons along with the extraordinary expense the
>authors of the AIDS "trojan" went to, we guessed that they would also
>use a "first class" encryption method.

Very naive analysis.  John McAfee writes:

>    A comparison of the encrypted and unencrypted entries
>indicates that some form of linear character mapping was used
>i.e.     # = I, } = A, 8 = E, @ = D, etc.)

In other words, "first class" equates to a Captain Midnight decoder
ring.  So much for this writer's expert analysis.

Does the AIDS program do what it purports to do?  Is that something that
the recipients were interested in having done?  Was it worth $.50 a day?

It is necessary to understand the answers to these questions in order to
know whether we are dealing with:

1) Attempted extortion;

2) A very expensive, obscurely motivated, and otherwise gratuitous
attack;

3) Or, a peculiarly inept attempt to market a program.

I like the idea of using a non-displayable character to conceal the
presence of a directory.  I also like the idea of using it on the end of
a file name in order to make it hard to establish addressability to the
file.

I like it now almost as much as I did when I first read the idea in the
readers' contributions to PC Magazine.

Subject: "Do not use this Diskette"

This advice published in association with the AIDS program is good
advice.

It is a special case of the advice that says use only programs or
diskettes that you expect from trusted sources.

This is a special case of the advice that says do not open mail that has
no return address, is not expected, or is otherwise suspicious.  In a
small number of cases it may be very dangerous to do so.

Subject: Spafford's Theorems

In general, I agree with theorems 1, 2, and 3.  I think that those that
deal with the future, are speculative.  However, in the same spirit and
along the same lines, I offer the following:

1. The amount of damage to data and availability done by viruses to date
has been less than users do to themselves by error every day.

2. The press speculation about the DATACRIME virus was much more
damaging than the virus.

3. The amount of damage that has been done to trust within the community
is orders of magnitude worse.

4. Viruses and rumors of viruses have the potential to destroy society's
already fragile trust in our ability to get computers to do that which
we intend while avoiding unintended adverse consequences.

5. We learn from the biological analogy that viruses are self-limiting.

Clinically, if you catch a cold, you will either get over it, or you
will die.  Epidemiologically, a virus in a limited population
will either make its hosts immune, or destroy the population.  Even in
open population, a virus must have a long incubation period and slow
replication in order to be successful (that is, replicate and spread).

6. The current vector for viruses is floppy disks and diskettes, not
programs.  That is to say, it is the media, rather than the programs,
that are moving and being shared.

A virus that is stored on such media will be very persistent.  One
infected diskette pulled from a drawer may began a new cycle.

On the other hand, diskettes as media have a limited life expectancy.
Punched paper lasted just a century; 8.5" floppies only a decade.  The
life of such media is a function of a number of complex factors.  The
success of the current technology augers for a long life, while the pace
of technology suggests that it will be short.

7. AIDS not withstanding, terrorists have more effective and efficient
mechanisms at hand.  Amateurs have a very high vested interest in a
community in which programs can be relied upon to do only what they
advertise.  It is to be hoped that they can be socialized not "to soil
their own sandpiles."

     Back in the 1970s, when I was working on secure operating systems,
I never dreamed that the day would come when there would be twenty five
million computers in the world running without memory protection.

     And it's going to get worse.  New and interesting programmatic objects
are coming into being.  Attacks need not be through object programs.
Already, there have been attacks via mail, and via text files editable by
GNU EMACS.  But this is just the beginning.

     - PostScript is a programming language.  Trojan horses could be
       embedded in PostScript files.  While attacking a printer isn't
       all that productive, Display PostScript offers more tempting
       targets.

     - A FAX message is a bitstream interpreted by an interpreter at
       the receving end.  Could it be induced to do something interesting
       through the use of illegal bit patterns?  Group III is probably too
       simple to be attacked, but group IV?  Imagine a message which
       causes a FAX machine to send an extra copy of transmitted documents
       to another location.

     - Network transmittable C++ objects are being developed.  Security
       doesn't seem to be mentioned.  This has promise.

     - Multi-media electronic mail offers new avenues of attack.

The basic problem is that the transmission of programmatic objects is
on the increase, and anything interpreted at the receiving end is
potentially a means of attack.  I predict that this will grow to a
moderately serious problem in the 1990s.
