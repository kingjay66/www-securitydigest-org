Subject: File Shield (PC)

A question on File Shield if I may? Is File Shield supposed to detect
all internal changes to a file, or just certain changes such as the
change of the file's time/date stamp?

Example, compile a program using MS 6.0 'C' and then use File Shield
to protect the program. Then use Norton Utilities to edit the compiled
file to change a letter in the copyright string.

When I do the above, File Shield does not pick up the change, or in
any event it does not report the change. If I change the time or date
stamp, File Shield picks it up immediately.

          COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

                           PRESS RELEASE


CPSR TO UNDERTAKE EXPANDED CIVIL LIBERTIES PROGRAM


CPSR, a national computing organization, announced today that it would
receive a two-year grant in the amount of $275,000 for its Computing and
Civil Liberties Project.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, founded by
Mitchell Kapor and John Barlow, made the grant to expand ongoing CPSR
work on civil liberties protections for computer users.

At a press conference in Washington today, Mr. Kapor praised CPSR's
work.  "CPSR plays an important role in the computer community.  For the
last several years, it has sought to extend civil liberties protections
to new information technologies.  Now we want to help CPSR expand that
work."

Marc Rotenberg, director of the CPSR Washington Office said, "We are
obviously very happy about the grant from the EFF.  There is a lot of
work that needs to be done to ensure that our civil liberties
protections are not lost amidst policy confusion about the use of new
computer technologies."

CPSR said that it will host a series of policy round tables in
Washington, DC, during the next two years with lawmakers, computer users
including "hackers," the FBI, industry representatives, and members of
the computer security community.  Mr. Rotenberg said that the purpose of
the meetings will be to "begin a dialogue about the new uses of
electronic media and the protection of the public interest."

CPSR also plans to develop policy papers on computers and civil
liberties, to oversee the Government's handling of computer crime
investigations, and to act as an information resource for organizations
and individuals interested in civil liberties issues.

The CPSR Computing and Civil Liberties project began in 1985 after
President Reagan attempted to restrict access to government computer
systems through the creation of new classification authority.  In 1988
CPSR prepared a report on the proposed expansion of the FBI's computer
system, the National Crime Information Center.  The report found serious
threats to privacy and civil liberties.  Shortly after the report was
issued, the FBI announced that it would drop a proposed computer feature
to track the movements of people across the country who had not been
charged with any crime.

"We need to build bridges between the technical community and the policy
community," said Dr. Eric Roberts, CPSR President and a research
scientist at Digital Equipment Corporation in Palo Alto, California.
"There is simply too much misinformation about how computer networks
operate.  This could produce terribly misguided public policy."

CPSR representatives have testified several times before Congressional
committees on matters involving civil liberties and computer policy.
Last year CPSR urged a House Committee to avoid poorly conceived
computer crime laws that could criminalize a wide range of computer
activity.  "In the rush to criminalize the malicious acts of the few we
may discourage the beneficial acts of the many," warned CPSR.  A House
subcommittee recently followed CPSR's recommendations on computer crime
amendments.

Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, an expert on the role of computer scientists and
public policy, praised the new initiative.  She said, "It's clear that
there is an information gap that needs to be filled.  This an important
opportunity for computer scientists to help fill that gap."

CPSR is a national membership organization of computer professionals,
based in Palo Alto, California.  CPSR has over 2,000 members and 21
chapters across the country.  In addition to the civil liberties
project, CPSR conducts research, advises policy makers and educates the
public about computers in the workplace, computer risk and reliability,
and international security.

Subject: 17xx family virus info needed (PC)

Could anybody out there provide me some information about the 17xx
family virus?  Some of my programs have been infected by these
viruses.  Any information related to the following is welcome:
1. The symptoms of 17xx family virus.
2. What harm it will do to the computer and programs?
3. How to get rid of it and where to get such tools?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: The Jerusalem virus (PC)

  I suppose most people on this list have managed, by now, to eradi-
cate the "Jerusalem" virus (Israeli Friday-the-13th virus) from their
disks.  But this virus is still widespread in some countries (e.g.
Japan), so just in case someone reading this doesn't have software to
remove the virus, I thought I'd post my usual warning:  This coming
Friday is a Friday-the-13th, so if you want to be on the safe side,
don't run programs on that day.  (BTW, if you boot when the system
date is set to a Friday-the-13th and one of your AUTOEXEC programs is
infected, it'll be too late to try to fool the virus by changing the
date to something else.)

  I would also like to take this opportunity to address a question to
John McAfee.  According to his statistics, there is one variant of the
Jerusalem which is far more common than all the others combined, and
that's "Jerusalem Virus Version B".  Now just what characterizes
this version?  When I first saw the name "Version B", I assumed it
referred to what Jim Goodwin called Jerusalem-B, which is the result
of removing the bug which caused multiple infections of EXE files.
But I have files infected with the *original* Jerusalem virus (which
does cause multiple infections), and when I ran SCAN (3.7V64) on them,
they were identified as "Strain B".  So if the original virus is
Strain B, what on earth is Strain A?
  I don't know if this is an error or the result of a peculiar naming
convention, but if you don't intend to change it, John, then I think
you should describe, here and/or in your program documentation, just
which strain each name (A, B, C, ...) refers to.
  Also, when I ran SCAN on files infected with the sURIV 1.01 and
sURIV 2.01 viruses, I was told they contained the same virus, "Suriv
A".  Since these are two entirely different viruses, this seems to be
an error.

  Another thing I've never been able to figure out is why SCAN and
CLEAN (or is it VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP?; the multiplicity of names is
confusing) are two separate programs.  If they were combined into one
(with disinfection made optional), this would make their use much more
convenient, not to mention more like other disinfectant programs.

Is the text you mentioned contained in straight ASCII in the virus
itself?  In that case, If you own a virus scanner which is modifiable
(that is, it works with a .dat file that contains the fingerprints of
virusses) you could easily adapt the scanner so that it will recognize
the virus.  For example, use as fingerprint the first line: "This
message is dedicated to".  That would be:

54686973206D6573736167652069732064656469636174656420746F

But you could just as easily pick one of the other lines (or all of them).

Now that we are talking fingerprints:

Does anybody own a list of known fingerprints of (the most common) virusses?
If so, could you please mail it to me, or better: post it on the net.
Tanks in advance.

[Ed. The danger in looking for ASCII strings, of course, is that you
could get a lot of false alarms.  This digest, for example, would be
identified as containing the virus, since it contains the string "This
message is dedicated to".  Perhaps searching for the string _and_ some
identifiable code would be more robust?  Just a thought...]

From:    Mark Parr <JPARR1@UA1VM.ua.edu>
Subject: Stoned and Stoned-II (PC)

Question....

How is the Stoned-II virus different from the Stoned virus?

Another one....

I found a couple of my floppies that were "infected" in the boot
sector with both.  Using VirusSCAN (V64), I got the following:

Scanning for known viruses.
Scanning boot sector of disk A:
  Found Stoned-II Virus (S-2) in boot sector.
  Found Stoned Virus (Stoned) in boot sector.

Using CLEANUP A: (S-2) I got a message saying that it could not be
safely removed.  However, when I did CLEANUP A: (Stoned), that worked
ok.  Then when I re-SCANed the program, Stoned-II was no longer there.
So, does removing Stoned remove Stoned-II or does this appear to be a
problem with SCAN.  The hard drive from which the floppies were
infected was found to be infected with just Stoned (This was
determined with SCANV63 -- that's what makes me think that it could
just be a bug -- unless V63 doesn't catch Stoned-II???).  Anyone got
any ideas on this?

NOTE: Brackets for SCAN were replaced with parentheses...   :)

On that note, it might be worthwhile to have a look at comp.std.unix, where
a similar discussion is underway.
