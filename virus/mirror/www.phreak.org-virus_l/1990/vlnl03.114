There was also  the DIR exec (VM)  which was supposed to give  a DOS type
display of  files but,  I believe,  after a  certain date  formatted your
minidisk. We never saw it but were warned by a number of lists.

   I work at a computer lab here on campus, and we had someone come in
   and ask about this..  I may not ahve this totally correct...

[much stuff deleted]

After some response (many thanks) and thought.  I and the person
involved have decided that this was a prank against him.  The tool
used was simply ResEdit.  The prankster edited the STR resource of the
application and the icon resource.  We are currently looking to set up
some security on his machine.  Thanks again for the help.  Much appreciated.

It sounds like that is a temporary document from the description of
the location of the file and the icon.  It's pretty easy to check
using MultiFinder or a file DA (like DiskTop).  Make sure that the
file is removed from the system folder, launch WordPerfect, and check
for the file.

Has anyone loaded VSHIELD into memory before invoking Windows 3.0?  If
so, did Windows functions properly?  Is the ability to detect viruses

Wrong!!!!  Or rather, right but there is a much better way.  First tho,
Disk Manager (a fine Minnesota company) makes software for more than Seagate
drives.  Also, you can make a full size partition using Ontrack software
(no need to make some Mickey Mouse 1 meg partition).
Call them at 1-800-752-1333.  That said, I'd advise against using
their software in your case.  Better you should format it using regular
DOS methods.  (Yes, I agree with the second writer, it sounds like an MFM
vs RLL problem).  If you have a Western Digital controller card, you are
in luck, cuz they too have a free number, with a snazzy recorded help that
you can navigate with a touch tone phone.  WD's number is:  1-800-356-5787.
Otherwise find someone who nows DOS there and can come over and walk you
through it.  Going the straight DOS way is best, you can avoid all sorts
of headaches later.

Luck!

          Does anybody know anything about a virus that eats up disk space.
Currently on this Network when I do a CheckVol the amount of free diskspace
seems to dwindle to 0.  I delete some old files, and in a matter of minutes
I have no more free space left.
          This is on a Novell Network and Zenith 386's.

If you don't consider it proprietary, I'd be curious to know what
the scanning algorithm is that it doesn't slow down as the number
of viruses increases.

I forwarded the question to Ross Greenberg, who has lost his USEnet

I can vouch for in the non-Usenet world.  In the Usenet world, any of the
anti-virus archives is probably safe and I know that SIMTEL20 (thanks,

Back on more regularly when I get a Usenet connection back...

Subject: GateKeeper Aid 'ADBS' Query (Mac)

A member of our computing center uses GateKeeper Aid on her Macintosh IIcx
and has received the following message:

          GateKeeper Aid found an "Implied Loader 'ADBS' virus in the Desktop
          file on the "Animal Sanctuary" disk.  The virus was removed.

"Animal Sanctuary" is the hard disk she was booting her machine from.  Gate-
Keeper Aid has caught and removed Wdef A from her machine on several
occasions.  No disk was inserted when this message appeared.  She runs
Microsoft QuickMail, Vaccine, AppleShare, and GateKeeper Aid.

I may be asking a question that's already been answered, but I couldn't
remember seeing any remarks about "Implied Loader 'ADBS' viruses" when
using GateKeeper Aid.  If anyone could tell me, or hazard a guess as to
what GateKeeper Aid found and what an "Implied Loader 'ADBS' virus" is I
would greatly appreciate it.  Please send replies directly to me if this
is something that has been discussed before.]

Thanks In Advance!

Agreed, the ten or so years MVS has on Unix isn't as significant.  This
was only a response to a statement about the number of people trying to poke
holes in Unix is greater than in MVS.  The knowledge of the people involved
and other resources used have a bigger impact.

My impression from the mainframe discussions that Unix attracts a
different class of attackers than does MVS or VM.  That none of the
MVS flaws had been exploited by hackers, but by knowledgeable people
with the specific purpose of finding holes, and Unix source code is
available (at least to some), intuitively it seems that Unix would be
easier to break into than MVS by non-systems people.  By the same token,
I suppose it would be easier to enhance Unix security.  Take into
consideration that information about MVS isn't readily available to
people outside of systems work.  hmmmmm......

Maybe so, maybe not.  Perhaps I take it for granted (somewhat) because
our installation keeps track of access controls (although there is still
room for improvement).  These penetration studies appear to contradict that
experienced people with the aid of special training and a large amount
resources only turned up integrity flaws in the high tens.  These studies
would suggest that number should be much higher.  I do doubt that anyone
but the systems people or very good applications people are going to be
able crack MVS, and then it's a case of having trustworthy people on staff.

*Some* instances of MVS or VM probably are no better (indeed, even worse)
than Unix (or for that matter, PCs).  This is a tsoris spot here too;
what good is buying an OS and a security system with  all the necessary
controls if you're going to cripple it?  I still feel MVS is a more secure
system, as long as you don't compromise what was put in place by IBM and
your security system vendor.

>...MVS installations are rife with very general utilities that run
>privileged and have poor controls.

So what?  One, joe-user doesn't have the ability to interrupt while the
utility is in supervisor state and do his own thing (OS integrity).  Two,
keep privileged programs (i.e., APF authorized) restricted to what comes
with the system, and systems people putting in any needed in-house
authorized programs (good security practice).

True, it does have little to do with viruses.  I did (and still do) agree
with what Dave has said; I think what this discussion evolved from is
a devil's-advocate scenario I had used:  "how does joe-user spread a virus
if he can't write to data other than his own, and other people can't
execute his programs."  No access controls or system integrity measures
in the world can prevent a virus from spreading around "legally" accessed
data.  The trick is indeed how you get it executed, and if the data is
widely shared, there isn't much magic involved.  You just have to know how
to stay in the user's address space and latch onto the next program that
gets executed.

If you restrict access, it becomes trickier to spread.  This, like you
said comes down to individual installations and how they have their system
set up (hopefully they're at least smart enough to protect their payroll
data from attacks :-) ).

In view of the myriad questions concerning oddly acting floppies, here
is the source code for a massive program written in a most
sophisticated and little known language (to be virus-free) that will
tell you what the CMOS thinks your floppy disk configuration is. This
has been through an extensive V&V program (five minutes - I had to
change the CMOS setup each time & reboot) on 1) a clone 386 with AMI
Bios and 2) a Zenith AT with the Zenith 386 kit. It may even work on
something else (usual disclaimers apply). I am sure that a neat little
