VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: SIMTEL20 status, a call for help

Since 1983, SIMTEL20 provided access to network mailboxes for various
users without their own network host.  We offer this service to Army,
other DoD services and agencies, and federal agencies, and their
contractors.  Until recently, it was possible to provide access to our
actively maintained software collections via FTP and on tape because
we already had that paying customer base to support.

For the past year or so, our paying customer base has dwindled.  The
anticipated separate funding for the Ada Software Repository did not
materialize.  The local backup funds has finally been exhausted due to
severe cutbacks.  Thus, we had to cancel the excellent contractor task
support provided by Rick Conn and Keith Petersen for the maintenance
of our Ada, MSDOS, MISC, CP/M collections and the tape copy service.

This cutback will not affect the independently maintained Unix/C and
Macintosh collections.  Access to our collections via conventional
ANONYMOUS FTP and LISTSERV/TRICKLE will also continue.

We always follow up leads on potential new customers.  Unfortunately,
none show much promise lately, due to similar severe funding cutbacks
in the respective organizations.  We have also been searching for
sources of institutional funding without success.

We understand that many of you consider SIMTEL20 to be a valuable
national and international resource.  We planned to greatly expand the
available disk space and improve access to this system through a
proposed connection to NSFNET through WESTNET.  We now need your help
in finding unconnected paying mailbox customers and potential
sponsors.

Specifically, we need to provide evidence to our management and
potential sponsors that this service has a real return on investment
and is a valuable resource to the government.  Because this is an Army
facility, we need documented proof from those in the Army first.  In
particular, we need to know how access to our collections has saved a
tangible amount of money or time to do your job.  Be specific, please.
Other DoD services and federal agencies are encouraged to contribute
their proof as well.

If you are a researcher or support researchers on government funded
tasks, can you document savings in cost or time because of your access
here?  If you work for a government contractor, check with your
management to see if they would be willing to support similar
documentation.

Please send your statement on your official letterhead and signed by
someone in top management, if possible.

Hi,
I have encountered a problem which could be a new virus.
When copying multiple files to my A: floppy, sometimes the floppy is destroyed
in a peculiar way. Part, but not all, of the rood directory is damaged: every
other byte becomes FF.  The FAT is also injured and almost all the clusters
are reported as used. In addition, the diskettes aquires a volume label, again
with FF in every other byte.

Scan V. 61 did not report a problem.

I am using DOS 3.30, running on a 386 clone (Chip and Technology Set.) Phoenix
BIOS dated 1/88.  The CPU is non-cached 20mhz. No co-processor.
QEMM is the memory manager.

The problem did not occur when booting from a clean floppy, without QEMM.
Do you need any additional information?
Thank you.

Virus scanners designed to run under DOS will most likely work right
if run in the DOS compatability box of OS/2; most DOS programs run
correctly there.  The only virus scanner that I know of that runs
under OS/2 itself is the IBM Virus Scanning Program (it is a "Family
Application", and will run under either DOS or OS/2).

Yes, some DOS viruses can operate and spread in the DOS compat box
of OS/2 (I don't think IOPL matters).   This is because some viruses
are, in the technical sense, "well-behaved" programs, doing all their
I/O via INT 21, not making too many assumptions about their control
of the environment, and so on.   I haven't tested this extensively,
but the 648 ("Vienna") virus seems to work just fine, the 1813
("Jerusalem") works sometimes, and some others no doubt work also,
to varying degrees.

Note that *no* DOS virus that I've seen can work in OS/2 itself,
since they all do at least one INT 21, and INT 21 doesn't work
under OS/2 (if you're not in the DOS box).

Much DOS anti-virus software should also work in the DOS box of
OS/2, and some (the IBM Virus Scanning Program, for instance)
will work under OS/2 itself.

Subject: LISTSERV files and security?

Hi!  Does anyone know what safeguards are taken against viri on the
various LISTSERV servers (on BITNET)?  I know simtel20 is very
careful, and I think that the TRICKLE servers are just extionsinos of
simtel20.  Is LISTSERV as safe?

Please reply by e-mail, as I don't often read this group.

Thanks in advance.

[Ed. All the archive files on the LISTSERV at Lehigh, LEHIIBM1.BITNET
(same machine as ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu), as well as the archive files on
cert.sei.cmu.edu, are read-only to the world; they are as safe as the
security mechanisms in their operating systems.]

Gatekeeper will combat this virus, but it must be in the notify & veto mode.

A recent (April or May?) issue of Reader's Digest had a lengthy
article on Stoll's pursuit of the hackers.  Not badly done for a
popular article.  One of the hackers ultimately committed suicide.

BBs's are one of the primary vectors for viruses. Joe Bugger leaves an
infected file on a bbs.  Ike Innocent downloads it, and gives a copy
to someone.  Then he runs it, and BINGO...infection city.  A much more
logical method, would be to have a trusted set of master disks and use
a high-speed duplicator to duplicate the disks.  then use a serializer
to serial number the disks.
