Subject: Re: EEPROM BIOS (PC)

I might point out that all systems using shadow ram can effectively
update their BIOS upon boot-up, by simply overwriting the shadowed
code. If the shadow areas are not write protected, any virus could
infect them. The images on disc would be subject to corruption,
although possibly not infection (being a BIOS image, it'd probably not
have a .COM or .EXE extention, so a virus probably wouldn't recognize
it as infectable). EEPROM might be a little safer, but not much.

     A few versions ago, John McAfee replaces SCANRES (which had some
TSR conflicts and generally didn't do a wonderful job in some
instances) with a new program called VSHIELD.  Look for a VSHIELD with
the same version as the current SCAN on SIMTEL20.  As of about a week
ago, the place to look on Simtel is:

PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>VSHLD66.ZIP

     That's the most current version last time I checked.  Another
plus about VSHIELD is that it will scan your system files on each
bootup.  It takes under 10K of RAM.

	Got an interesting ad in today's mail. The flyer, from 1st
Defense Anti-Viral Systems of Broadview Heights, Ohio, announces the
discovery of a virus which uses the modem on your PC to run up your
phone bill. They call it the Telecomm Virus (V92), and remark that it
"has not previously been eported in 'the literature'".
	Fortunately, it was discovered in Texas by tow individuals
who, fortunately, had a copy of the 1st Defense package, available for
just $59.95 (no doubt reduced from the list price of $60.00 :+} ),
Ohio residents add 7%.
	Isn't it nice how the folks who discovered this new virus just
happened to have the correct anti-viral program loaded? Anyone want to
buy some underwater real estate in Florida? Alligators included at
minimal extra cost.

The protection of "protected mode" could cut both ways, however.
Although it would be harder for a virus to gain access to a system, it
would also be harder to detect and kill.  You can't scan memory for a
virus if you get nailed by a segment violation whenever you look
outside your own data.  The only way to look for a virus would be to
ask the OS about it, and if a virus has tinkered with the OS, you're
in trouble.  Hopefully manufacturers will make incompatible machines
which look the same to legitimate programs (because the OS handles
everything) and viruses will die out of sheer UN*X-style hardware-base
fragmentation.

Subject: Measuring the Spread of Viruses

Has anyone done any work on measuring the degree to which viruses (as
a whole or as individual strains) have spread throughout the
population of personal computers?  This could be done either by
collecting statistics on the number of reported cases or, more
elaborately, sending out surveys to various sites
(academic/commercial/government) and individual users (e.g.
subscribers to various magazines).

There is a tendency among naive users to blame every occurence of
unusual system behavior on "a virus".  I'm curious to what extent this
is a reasonable response to the current level of virus infestation and
to what extent this is just paranoia (or perhaps hypochondria).

It would be interesting to track the growth in the number, type, and
capabilities of viruses as a function of time.  I can remember
listening to a talk on viruses as an undergrad (circa 1985) in which
viruses were basically academic curiousities as *potential* future
threats to security -- for better or for worse, we've come a long way
in a short time...

What are the criteria of an 'out of control' virus?  Should one take
the same point of view with the common cold?  "It's out of control so
I don't care who I give it to?"

>I do not exercise any real control over Jerusalem B; it is out of

Who's to say Jerusulam B in particular is out of control?  Many
viruses are contained in a relatively small geographic area.
Spreading them around, no matter how prevalent in that one area, seems
foolish to me.  Last year, our labs were had an epidemic of WDEF
(Mac), and we had cases for months, until all the user's disks were
cleaned out.  Now we've been going for months now with very few
re-infections.  What is once a 'common' virus can be a rare one in
months, with the right detection software.

Subject: Re: Anti-virus viruses

I am not arguing in favor of AVVs, but have a few technical ideas to
throw out for discussion:

One method of limiting the risk of an AVV would be to make it spread
more rapidly where there are other viruses than where there are not.
For example, the virus could award itself "food points" every time it
"eats" a bad virus, and require a certain number of points before it
attempts to replicate.  The copy, of course, starts life with no food
points ...

This way, the AVV would be almost unable to spread among systems which
were apparently clean, but would spread rapidly in an obviously sick
environment.  This property could be quite useful in focusing the
concentration of the AVV to where it was needed the most.

Many variants of this scheme are possible.  For example, the virus
might split food points with its copy, but then lose a point every
time it runs and there's nothing to disinfect.  Eventually it could
"starve" and remove itself.  If the virus was on read-only media, and
hence unable to accumulate food points, it could replicate with a low
probability each time it ate something, giving much the same effect as
saving up points.

Another safety feature would be to publish all the information needed
to recognize and disinfect the virus, a few months before releasing
it.  That way no one would have to have it that didn't want to and
already had means for virus protection.

A polite AVV might ask before committing suicide, so the user had the
choice of some other software to do the job.

Computer "organisms" have always had the potential to alter their own
"genetic code" at will.  Encryption is far easier than changing DNA to
something else.

How complicated and effective does a "virus" have to be before you
call it a bacterium?  And have we yet seen the computer equivalent of
a multicellular organism (maybe the Internet worm?)?  (Only in a
multitasking OS, of course ...)  Will the future bring a "social
insect", identical programs operating cooperatively, ant-like, on
multiple nodes of a large network, seeking storage space and CPU time
for their own ends?

I wonder what fraction of the human genetic code is "dedicated solely
to avoiding detection and removal"?  Perhaps as much as that dedicated
to avoiding starvation, or failure to reproduce.

Subject: 1559 virus, Drew U. has been hit (again) (PC)

        Yes, Drew University has had a problem with the 1559 (1554?)
virus.  We found it last March/April, and managed to get rid of some
infected programs.

        Just today (Monday, 17-Sep), one of our freshpersons came down
to the computer center.  Her computer wouldn't boot off the hard
drive.  After a few minutes of realizing that there was some kind of
very, very strange problem, I Viruscanned the drive.  Of course, 1559
was found on it.  She had been given the virus by an unwitting
Sophomore, who had gotten it from his roommate, who might've picked it
up from somewhere else.

        We've found at least four generations (of users) who have it.
We have no idea how far it has spread.  Our informal survey showed
that only 25-30% of the campus bothered to check their disks for the
virus.  Part of that was the fact that users a) don't understand
viruses -- they don't WANT to understand them and b) they're so
amazingly apathetic.

        Right now we're trying to assess just how badly we were hit.
One saving point, from a detection standpoint, is that if the virus is
interfering with disk writes, it eventually nails the boot sector,
making the hard drive unbootable, but accessable after a floppy boot.
Zenith MS-DOS writes the current time and date to the boot sector
every once in a while; I don't know if other DOS versions do this.

        Anyway, Academic Computing is now in the position of saying "I
told you so," since others (other depts., administrators, etc.)
thought the problem was gone.  Hopefully, some of things that should
have been done the first time will happen now.

Subject: Whale virus (PC)

More about the 'Whale' virus....

John McAfee is correct in saying that the signature string I posted
recently will not detect all infected files - it will only detect the
first few generations, before the virus starts to mutate.

I have not observed some of the more unusual things reported regarding
this virus - the ability to modify other viruses for example.  The
virus may be related to the 'Fish' variant of 'Frodo', but as far as I
know this relationship is only a speculation.

One interesting item, though - hidden within the virus, under three
levels of encryption, is the following string

             THE WHALE IN SEARCH OF THE 8 FISH
             I AM '~knzyvo}' IN HAMBURG addr error D9EB,02

The following (anonymous) note was posted on the VIRUS ECHO on Fidonet
- - rather interesting....

    If you have the motherfish, you are entitled to an
    explanation...when we discovered the motherfish, the
    decision was made to disavow its existence and any
    public comment on it was prohibited...the file was
    never made available through normal distribution based
    on two findings 1. the virus can not be detected by
    present methods 2. the virus is modularly constructed
    to allow it to "learn" the methods used to detect it,
    and then integrate this coded thought into its arsenal
    of defense mechanisms.........the motherfish is
    not just a virus, it is a virtual living, breathing
    entity that is capable of teaching itself its pursuers
    techniques and then increasing its code level
    sophistication as its environment becomes increasingly
    hostile...this characteristic made it imperative that
    distribution be kept at an absolute minimum...it would
    be appreciated if you kept that in mind.

Saying that 'the virus can not be detected by present methods' is not
100% correct - McAfee has already announced a detector and disinfector
and I am working on another myself - it will be included in version
1.14 of F-PROT.
