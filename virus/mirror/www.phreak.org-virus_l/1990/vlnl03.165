Subject: Disk write loses 10 characters --- a virus?

Hi, NetLanders,

I have recently been asked to look at an Epson Equity (PC compatible)
which is behaving strangely when writing to the hard disk.  All the
files are read fine, but I discovered that whenever I try to write any
file onto the hard disk, the first 10 bytes of the data to be written
are lost.  EXACTLY 10 bytes.  Every time.  I then tried to boot the
machine with a write-protected DOS disk and the problem went away.
However, as soon as I tried to run a copy of PFS:Write from a diskette,
the problem appeared again.  Any pointers?

Thanks.

Subject: 4096 virus info, in German (PC)

    I found this message in the German Computerweek magazin, but I'm
    not able to translate it correctly. So I hope you got somebody for
    the translation, and also I hope this will be interested.

    Virus - Update

    Hilfe gegen Tarnkappen - Viren:

    Das infame 4096-, alias Frodo - Virus, das sich resident in den
    Hauptspeicher ldt und dort dafr sorgt, daa es fr alle gngigen
    Utilities unsichtbar ist (siehe CW 33 vom 17. August 1990, S.10), hat
    eine Achillesfers - eben seine Unsichtbarkeit. Beim Kopieren eines
    infizierten Programms ist unter bestimmten Umstnden die Kopie
    virusfrei. Voraussetzung: Das Virus ist resident im Hauptspeicher und
    die Namens-Extension der Zieldatei ist nicht die einer ausfhrbaren
    Datei (COM, EXE, OVL oder SYS.) Dann nmlich filtert das residente
    Virus, um sich wie gewohnt zu verstecken, seinen Code aus dem
    Bytestrom heraus.
    In der Zieldatei kommt damit nur der ursprngliche Programmcode an.
    Am besten verwendet man fr diese Prozedure ein Komprimierprogramm
    wie PKARC. Inwieweit es mit den DOS-Programmen COPY und XCOPY
    funktioniert, ist noch umstritten.
    Anschlieaend mssen die infizierten Programme gelscht, das System von
    einer definitiv "sauberen" Diskette gebootet und die Kopien wieder
    dekomprimiert (beziehungsweise mit den richtigen Extensions versehen)
    werden.
    Virus-Experten jedoch warnen vor dieser "Therapie". Weil sie nicht so
    einfach ist, wie sie klingt, sollten sich nur Leute an ihr versuchen,
    die mit ihrem PC auf Bit-Level vertraut sind. Die sicherste Lsung
    seien professionelle Antivirusprogramme, deren neuere Versionen diesen
    "Erreger" bereits erkennen, wie der Virenscanner von Solomon
    (Findviru), McAfee (Scan) oder Skulason (F-Fehler). Das Programm Turbo
    Anti Virus von EPG International kann Ihn angeblich auch gleich
    entfernen.
    Noch zwei Hinweise:
    1. Signaturprogramme und Virenscanner sollten nur von einer garantiert
    sauberen Diskette gestartet werden und nur dann, wenn der PC zuvor von
    einer ebenso sauberen Diskette gebootet wurde.
    2. Wird das Virus aktiv, gibt es aufgrund eines Programmfehlers die
    Meldung "Frodo Lives" nicht aus. Statt dessen hngt sich der Rechner
    auf.

Subject: Icon displays (Mac)

Just to put Paul Carapetis at ease:

The display of file/data/program icons on the screen of the Mac is
essentially a function of the Mac operating system (or desktop). The
appearance of an icon does not imply that the associated file has
executable facilities for display of such an icon, in the same way
that an MS-DOS file does not have code to display its filename.ext
when you enter a DIR command.

However, should an icon alter its appearance then this can only be
attributed to executable code which may be contained anywhere on the
system, not necessarily within the associated file. This follows from
the fact that the icon is essentially no more than a pixel map. Mac
users will know that the map contains small, background and
highlighted descriptions. You can even edit them using ResEdit or
similar tools. I don't recommend it.

Subject: Jerusalem B (PC)

I am the Technical Assistant for the Computer Center at Bard College,
a small liberal arts institution in upstate New York.  Right now we
have an exclusively IBM PC based, non-networked facility for student
use (due to change soon...).  Being a low tech school with 95% of
usage being word processing, and not much outside software being
brought into the center, we have not had any virus problems until very
recently.

About two weeks ago, the Jerusalem B virus found its way onto one of
our center's WordPerfect v4.2 disks.  This version of WordPerfect
refused to run with the infection.  We cleaned off the disks by
recopying them from masters.

Then, on Friday (9/28) we discovered Jerusalem B again on three
disks-- WP v4.2, WP v5.0, and a Turbo Pascal v2.0 .  Very
irritating...  but what concerns me is the amount of infection and the
behavior of the virus with WP v5.0 and the Turbo Pascal.  Both of
these programs were invokable, and the behavior upon invocation was
different than with WP v4.2.  With WP v4.2 it scanned both disk drives
(presumably for other disks to infect), loaded itself into memory,
infected the resident portion of DOS, and then tried to run WP.  With
the other two programs, however, the virus exhibited none of the above
activity.

Here are some specific questions:

1) What is the behavior of Jerusalem B?  Does it do anything vile
other than infect all of the .COM and .EXE files that it can find (or
so I thought, see #2 below...)?  (e.g. will it wait for the next
partial lunar eclipse in Iceland and then erase all data and display
three leaping purple frogs on the screen...)

2) There were five .COM files on the Turbo Pascal v2.0 disk that it
infected: TURBO.COM, TURBO-87.COM, FORMAT.COM, TINST.COM, and
COMMAND.COM.  It only infected TURBO.COM, with two infections each.
Does Jerusalem B only infect programs that are invoked from the
command prompt while it is in memory?  Or is it supposed to infect all
.COM and .EXE files that it finds?

3) Under what conditions does a multiple infection occur (one
executable file found to have multiple copies of the virus in it)?

4) Are there many versions of Jerusalem B out in the world, making the
above questions inappropriate and/or difficult to answer?

Thanks.  Any tips, thoughts, or info on this will be most appreciated.

Did SAM 2.0 automatically check for the ANTI virus before (I'm

This is not correct. However, there was one small flaw in my
conclusion, though not the idea behind it, which this reminds me of.

In fact, icons are *not* stored as executable code. It is easy to make
a file with an icon that has no code. So that's not a specific route
for a virus.

However, there is an important point I didn't make in the last
posting. What I said was, a sound (as we currently know them) cannot
be infected by any virus.  This does *not* lead to the conclusion that
a sound _file_ cannot be infected.  The problem is the way that the
Mac deals with resource forks. If you are an application and you--

Oh no. I've just invented a virus.

- --fortunately, GateKeeper Aid (and probably SAM Intercept) will deal
with it.  As I was saying, If you're an application and you open a
resource file of any sort, for any reason, *all* of it's resources,
including CODE and various ?DEFs, get used in preference to yours. So
you could write a virus that chose to live in any resource file, and
it could spread very quickly.

In fact, there is one virus that will "infect" non-application
resource files, including sounds, but it doesn't qualify, because the
baby viruses are stillborn- not executable or infectious. It's called
INIT 29.

Anyway, I stand by my first statement absolutely. No copy of nVIR will
EVER infect a sound file. Ever. No exceptions.

BTW, somebody sent me mail a few days ago. It got badly mangled by the
mailer (like when the post office sends you a cancelled stamp in a
plastic bag and says "sorry about mis-handling your mail!") but it
occurs to me now from the line or so that survived that it might have
been a response to my first note. If it was, you might care to
re-send.

On a related subject, many of my clients are worried about viruses
that target their specific operating environment. I am referring to
sophisticated entities here, such as banks and defense contractors,
that use computers for very important work involving millions of
dollars worth of transactions or life-and-death process control. It is
time we all acknowledged that in certain situations, viruses can cause
damage that is MUCH greater than the value of disk files. Prudent
businesses need to be concerned about "insider jobs" using viruses,
trojan horses, logic bombs, etc. that target them specifically. These
"inside jobs" may also target whatever defense mechanisms may be in
place. I have been referring to these attacks as "surgical strikes".
Perhaps a better term would be "targetted strikes". Although I am
aware of organizations that have purchased sophisticated defense
mechanisms to counter these kinds of attacks, I don't think knowledge
of the insider attacks will ever be as widespread as our knowledge of
more conventional viruses has become. This is because of the sensitive
nature of the attacks and damages done. The victims of these surgical
strikes handle them internally and secretly.

Subject: _Possible_ NEW Yom Kippur virus alert?? (Mac)

	I'm not sure, but I might be infected with a new virus.  Maybe
you can tell me.

SYMPTOMS: One and only one - so far...  "Armor Alley" will not run if
the date/time is set to a date after 9/29.  If the date is set to 9/29
or earlier the program runs fine.  According to Three-Sixty's
"hot-line" the program doesn't even look at the clock.

DISCOVERY?: Purchased and installed Armor Alley on Saturday (9/29 -
Yom Kippur).  The program ran fine.  (One bomb-box when it and Sound
Master's hourly chime grabbed the sound channel at the same time.)

	On Sunday, rather than running, the exact same copy of Armor
Alley just quit to the finder.  No alerts, no bombs, no messages -
just a silent abort back to the finder.  After going crazy trying to
isolate the problem, (see below) I decided the only difference was what
day it was, and tried changing the clock.

	When I found changing the clock *did* make it fail or run,
depending on the setting, (and verifying it by trying it both ways
several times)  I realized that the 'failure date' was Yom Kippur, a
very popular date for time-bomb viruses.  That, and the question "but
what else could it be?" leads me to this posting.

OTHER THINGS I'VE TRIED:  Not everying I tried was virus related.  Most
of this was done to "shake things loose" and find what was "wrong" with
my Mac.

	A) Scanned entire hard drive (including "Armor Alley") and
		"Armor Alley" floppy with Disinfectant 2.1  (That's the
		latest, right?) Nothing found.
	B) Restored/replaced System, Finder and Multifinder (more than
		once)
	C) Tried both Finder and Multifinder
	D) Reset parameter ram
	E) Recopied game/loaded off of (locked) master floppy. (more
		than once)
	F) "Removed" all INIT but Aask and Disinfectant INITs.  (Didn't
		really remove 'em - used Aask.)
	G) Verified hard drive
	H) Defragmented and optimized hard drive partitions (What the
		heck - they needed it.)
	I) Re-installed SCSI disc driver.
	J) Deleted desktop, did re-build.
	K) Booted off of copy of 6.0.2 System Tools floppy, dismounted
		hard drive partitions, stared Armor Alley from copy of
		master floppy.

None of these would cause the program to run.

	L) Ran a good number of other programs, none of which showed
any sign of trouble.  (Sim City, Think 4.0

SUSPICIONS:

	Step "K" above, limits what could be going on, as I see it, to
	one of four things.

	1)  I have an unknown virus on my hard drive that A)
Disinfectant 2.1 cannot find *and* B) can contaminate a floppy duing a
floppy to floppy copy (single 800k drive)

	2)  My copy of "Armor Alley" contains a virus that Disinfectant 2.1
cannot find.

	3)  The program itself has been "booby-trapped."

	4)  Some other very strange thing is happening with my Macintosh.

	I tend to discount 2 and 3.  If either were the case, I would
not be alone with this problem, and so far the Three-Sixty hot-line
hasn't hear of this problem from anyone but me.

	So what do I do now?  Suggestions are *very* welcome.  Use
e-mail, and I'll summarize as the drama (if any) unfolds.


MACHINE:
	Mac II, 5Mb RAM, 100Mb Rodime RX-100, standard color monitor &

Disinfectant 2.2
================

October 2, 1990

Disinfectant 2.2 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.2 recognizes a new strain of the ANTI virus recently discovered
in France.

Version 2.2 includes new "Desktop Files" commands in the Scan and Disinfect

menus. These commands can be used to quickly check for and remove the WDEF
and CDEF viruses.

Version 2.2 corrects an error in the alert displayed by the INIT if an
infection is discovered in the System folder during startup.

Version 2.2 also corrects an error in the positioning of new windows on
classic 9 inch Mac screens.

Due to an error in the Rodime Cobra disk driver, Disinfectant does not work

properly on Cobra drives. According to Rodime tech support, this problem
can be fixed by reinstalling the driver with the disk cache code disabled.
See the "Special Features" section of the 2.2 online manual for details.

The Disinfectant sample source code has also been updated to version 2.2.

Disinfectant 2.2 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
acns.nwu.edu [129.105.49.1].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu, comp.binaries.mac,
CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet, America Online, Calvacom,
AppleLink, and other popular sources of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of free
and shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by sending a
self-addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy disk to the author
at the address below. People outside the US should send an
international postal reply coupon instead of US stamps (available from
any post office). Please use sturdy envelopes, preferably cardboard
disk mailers.

Subject: Question about Whale Virus (PC)

Hi.  I'm posting this for a friend - Dragon@RCN, if you wish to respond
personally.

I was reading through the digests of this list, and heard about a
virus called the "Whale" Virus.  I was wondering, how common is it,
where does it occure, and other information like that.  In addition,
is it possible to "trap" a Whale Virus on a floppy disk, and if so,
what could it do to a system (Tandy 1000, original model) without a
hard drive, or a modem.  Could it do any damage to the system, and if
not, what would it do while "living" in the floppy?  Are there any
viruses that can "hurt" the actual hardware of a computer that does
not contain a hard drive?

Also, I was wondering if the first version of Ultima 6, (the one with
billions of errors) could be suffering from a virus.
It seems as if only the MAP disk is corrupted, though I still get an
occasional error from the program.

Thank you.

Hello all,

There is a new virus in Israel he was discovered on a bbs, on a file
names SCAN.COM in a package SCANV68.ZIP so please inform Mcafee not to
publish a SCAN ver. numbered 68.

Some info that was posted over BBS's net follow's.

[Ed. As this information looks (to me) to be somewhat sketchy, I urge
readers to regard it as unconfirmed until/unless more information can
be found.  If anyone does have any _first hand_ information on this, I
would appreciate a call or an e-note.  (krvw@cert.sei.cmu.edu or
(412) 268-7090)]

   Attention all computer users.
The file SCANV68.ZIP as downloaded from 'On-Line Today' includes one SCAN.COM
file of size about 63Kb. This file when run immidiately terminates, as it
includes nothing but one INT 20 (termination) and 60Kb of junk.
But, it is also infected by a virus that has a very limited ability:
it hooks interrupt 21H (Dos function call) and hooks ONE .COM file in the
current directory every time INT 21 is called. It put itself in high memory
without changing high mem counter, so that any big program hangs the system.
Command.com will not work when infected, so that infection will cause system
to hang on BOOT. It has a very bad BUG when hooking INT 21H which causes
Command.com to misinterpret commands, so that any DEL will cause deletion of
whole directory (I repeat: It is only a BUG!!!).

It's main Symptom is typing a message unto screen every 8th INT 21H request:
HEY SADAM
LEAVE QUEIT BEFORE I COME

It's size is about 700 bytes.
It is also very bad programmed, probably by someone who has very little
control of assembly language.

There's nothing to avoiding it:
When you get a new COM program, run it in an EMPTY directory eight times.

C:> MKDIR EMPTY
C:> CD EMPTY
C:EMPTY> COPY \PROCOMM\SCAN.COM
    $One file(s) copied ...
C:EMPTY> SCAN
    $Does NOTHING.
C:EMPTY> SCAN
C:EMPTY> SCAN
C:EMPTY> SCAN
C:EMPTY> SCAN
HEY SADAM
LEAVE QUEIT BEFORE I COME
C:EMPTY>


   Ah hah!!!
Continue? [Y/n/=]:
LEAVE QUEIT BEFORE I COME
C:EMPTY>

   Ah hah!!!

C:EMPTY> DEL *.*
Are you sure (yes/no): Y
C:EMPTY>

 Now BOOT!!! Further use of DOS might cause damage to directory.

Thank you to all who have set me straight on mac icons.  I now better
understand the mechanics in use and you have inspired me to do some
study on the internal operations of the mac.  This will be directly
useful as there are several macs in my area that fall into my area of
responsibility.

Thanx again,
