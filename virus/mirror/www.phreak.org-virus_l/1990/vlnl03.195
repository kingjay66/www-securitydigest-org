Subject: Keeping the Icons off the screen / Gatekeeper Aid (Mac)

Netters...

I have an interesting request to make.  I am looking for a way to keep
the icons from Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid off the screen during
startup.  At the same time, I would like to keep them from appearing
in the control panel, but I could do without that.  Let me explain
why.

I am currently working for a lab at Penn State University's Visual
Arts Department, and in general, I am in charge of maintaining and
upgrading the lab.  This includes virus detection and prevention for
the students who use this lab (who really wouldn't know a virus if it
hit them).

However, my direct supervisor is a little hazy on the idea of Virus
protection.  Not usually a problem, but a few weeks ago, he requested
that we remove all 'unnecessary' INITs from the machines in the lab.
This was followed by someone claiming that the virus protection we
were using was 'copyrighted' and eventually led him to request (read
order) us to remove all the virus protection we were using.

I am stuck in a kind of dilemma.  On one side, I am trying to convince
him that what we are using is perfectly legal, and indeed necessary,
and on the other side, I am unwilling to let the lab go unprotected
while he 'makes up his mind.'  Then, while reading an article in a
past Virus-L, someone mentioned setting up an anti-WDEF device so it
didn't appear on the screen at startup, and I realized that is
probably just what we need in the intern.

So, I am looking for help.  Is there any way to prevent Gatekeeper Aid
from putting it's icon on the screen at startup (I know you can turn
off the icon in Gatekeeper, but I am not sure about G.Aid).  Also, is
there a way to set up Gatekeeper, and then lose the control panel?

Please send all replies directly... and, if there is sufficient
interest, I l will summarize for the net.

Subject: Fu-Manchu infection (PC)

Last night I had a 'wonderful' (?) time (until 3:00am) cleaning-up a
C: drive full of Fu-manchu virus-infected .com files, detected using
McAfee's SCAN program.
   However, I am puzzled about this infection. It seems to have been
triggered by a program lying around at the bottom of my drawer called
INOC2048.EXE and claiming to inoculate files against this Fu-manchu
virus. Are my files actually virusized or is it just another case of
clashes between two types of anti-viral software ? Indeed, is the only
way to get rid of the virus actually deleting the infected file ?  I'm
asking this because out of 146 .com files, I am missing backups for 14
.com files.

Thanks,

If no-one reports a crime, then the police will think it don't happen.
Also, they will not give any resources for fighting that crime! So
report those viruses (yes crimes). The next time I find one, I am going
to.

Well, my suspicions have been calmed and I can say with 99% certainty
that this is _not_ a virus. Thanks for all the replies I received
which were helpful and prompt; particularly Tris Orendorff. This list
deserves its good reputation.

The "knackered" message was put on my PC (I believe) by one of my
fun-loving colleagues in the custom message box that NDD II now has.
The machine that was trashing the disks that produced the error is
simply broken.

I can be (99%) certain that this is not a virus as I have been using
checksumming programs and string-searchers and neither have shown
anything over the past couple of weeks. I could not find the
"knackered" text anywhere on my hard disk after re-installing Norton
(which I did early on, i.e. I have never found it). All these from a
clean DOS disk too. Apologies to Peter Norton for suspecting his
package.

I also wrote:

Well, I found out that Australasia knows it but America doesn't. My
favourite suggestion for a 'nasty' message was "Your disk is toast!"
(especially the way I cook my toast).

The "original" STONED checks the media byte in the boot sector and would
only infect 360k 5 1/4 floppies. I suspect that this machine uses 3 1/2s.

Without complete detail, an interrupt is simply a special form of calling
a subroutine. Int 13 utilities generally intercept the interrupt and check for
"unusual" requests. Next, you have to understand the order in which a PC boots:
(part of a two day course I teach to technicians here). Leaving out a lot of
detail, when turned on or booted, a PC first executes POST clearing memory.
loads the low level interrupts (including 0-1F), checks for ROM extensions,
checks for a floppy (A) followed by a hard disk in that order, reads the first
physical sector from whichever is found first (some machines let you specify),
and jumps to the first byte of what it found. If a partition table (hard disk)
it points to the boot record (logical sector 1 of the partiton marked "active")
which is then loaded and executed. If a floppy or some old fixed disks with no
partiton table, this is the boot record. If a virus, it can do anything it
wants. This loads the two system files which read & load the config.sys
contents, loads COMMAND.COM, and then executes AUTOEXEC.BAT if found.

Now the PRINTSCREEN (according to VSUM) is a boot sector infector & goes
resident long before any Int 13 intercept loaded by AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS
can take control (why GOOD anti-viral utilities are so difficult to write).
My suspician is that the virus has simply intercepted the interrupt 13 vector
so that any call to Int 13 is passed to the virus. Your Int 13 intercept is
probably sitting fat, dumb, and happy on top of DOS watching high level
operations while the virus is mucking around down in the engine compartment.

1) Make sure the virus is not resident (CHKDSK or Int 12)
2) Check floppies for three k in bad sectors
3) Use DEBUG to replace the boot sectors on infected ones.
or
Get McAfee's CLEAN (71B is current), read the .DOC, boot from a known-
unifected floppy, invoke: CLEAN a: /many [Brain]<cr>, and swap floppies in a:
as required, send John currency.

While I agree with Stephen Carter that the size of the Scotland Yard
team is derisory, there is some logic to their request to be informed
specifically; as I understand it, their hands are tied unless someone
explictly complains to them.  Our crazy legal system is definitely
biased in favour of the criminal...

Subject: re: EB21 or PrintScreen virus (PC)

deepak@shakti.ernet.in asks how the PrintScreen virus can read/write
disks without doing INT13s (and therefore without being caught by some
INT13-hooking anti-virus program).  I don't want to give enough detail
to be of help to future virus writers, but in general boot viruses get
control early enough that they can easily access the INT13 call-chain
down below the level at which any given DOS program (or even DOS
itself) has woven itself in; that is, they can just call the "real"
INT13 code directly, without ever doing an actual INT13.  Many boot
viruses, including the PrintScreen, do this; no magic...  DC

Subject: re: MusicBug (PC)

Looks to me like the MusicBug is finding sufficient unused clusters in
the FAT to hold its non-boot-sector code, marking them as used (with
FF's, rather than as "bad" with F7's), and writing itself there.
Depending on what the FAT looks like at the time of the infection, the
position of the clusters used will differ.  This also means that
CHKDSK will show lost clusters on an infected disk.  (I haven't tested
this on hard disks yet, only diskettes.)  DC

Seems to me you could make that into a pretty good security and
anti-virus program by popping up a permit/deny window every time it
detected something trying to change an interrupt vector. Only trouble
is that anybody using it would have to know his interrupts cold so he
can decide what to allow - if you deny everything most of your
programs won't run. Of course, one could always make a list of "legal"
interrupt changes and legal values to change them to based on offsets
from the code segment of a particular executing program.

Our lives would be much easier if MS-DOS had been designed with even the
slightest of concessions to security...

Subject: MS/PhD in computer security

A while ago I posted a request asking for information on schools where
one might pursue a computer-security related MS/PhD program.  Ken
asked me to compile a summary, and here it is.  As can be expected,
the information about some of the schools is not of much use.

I exclude all the schools where the only information provited was
something like:

    "Give my school a try... we have a great Comp. Sci. program!"

One school was mentioned by several people - Carnegie-Mellon, and from
the responses I received, it seemed to be one of the best choices.

The other schools...

George Washington University, Washington, DC

   "...an active group of grad students working on computer
    security with one working on viruses specifically."

University of Cincinnati.

   " We have a security specialist, George Purdy, who wrote the VMS password
     stuff - although he's more into crytography and such, than viruses.
     The CS MS program is fairly new, and they are currently working on
     getting a PhD program initiated.  As with most programs, one could get
     out without learning all that much, but there is potential for learning
     a lot, if you take it upon yourself to work hard."

Lehigh University

     "You might want to consider Lehigh University (original home of VIRUS-L)."

Purdue

     "As far as security goes, we have three people here with security
      interests and expertise...lacking only motivated students to tackle
      some interesting research problems."

Subject: Batch for Scan and Clean (PC)

I'm glad John McAfee has put in the /REPORT option in SCAN version 71.
It makes writing a batch file that Scans AND Cleans viruses a little
less complicated.

I have written such a batch file but I was hoping to see if anybody
has had an better ideas for doing it. I have two batch files which
work together.  They are rather long winded but they only cover
viruses which I know Clean can remove with no difficulty. I'm sure
others have also written batch files to do the same.

In an educational computer lab, it is rather a neccesity to Scan *AND*
Clean computer viruses. Anybody having a good working batch file or
anyone wishing to see a copy of my batch files, please contact me via
Email at the address below.
