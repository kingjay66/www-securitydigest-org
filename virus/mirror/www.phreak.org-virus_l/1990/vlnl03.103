Not really; as I said (too quietly) in my posting, the numbers I gave
are combined figures for a few years, not recent numbers only.  We
haven't seen lots of 17xx and BB *recently*; I'd say (I hope to have
harder numbers to post eventually) that the 1813 and Stoned are "among
the front-runners", with the BB back in the pack somewhere, and the
17xx's trailing a little behind...  DC

Subject: Positive Effects of Viruses?

Some extracts from an article in New Scientist (19 May 1990), any comments?

Thanks for wiping the memory: Harold Thimbleby looks at the bright side of
computer viruses.

...I think viruses are going to bring about several changes in computing, all
of which will be beneficial...

So far as a user is concerned there is no difference between a bug (an
accidental program fault) and a virus (a deliberate self propagating
fault.) I'm pepared for viruses but there is nothing to protect me
from bad software.  Most software manufacturers provide a very flimsy
warranty...it is time they took a professional attitude to their work
by accepting some liability for the work that they do. The pressure to
do this will come from viruses. While we let software manufacturers
hide behind their unprofessional warranties, we have little redress
against deliberately malicious programmers.

Keeping up to date with new anti-viral programs often means
subscribing to an antiviral product so that you can easily get
updates. So viruses put the pressure on to make the upgrading of
software easier.  The basic problem is that we but computers that can
perform all sorts of functions many of which we don't need. Because
computers can do anything they can run viruses. If we bought computers
that could only do a few specific things - in the same way that a
pocket calculator can only be a pocket calculator - then the computers
simply would not be able to run viruses.  This new design of computer
would have to be completely incompatible with all current computers.

There would be several advantages to computer users including the fact
that if viruses were unable to corrupt programs then anyone else would
also find it harder. If it is harder to modify programs once they have
been sold then manufacturers are going to have to take a lot more care
in preparing them. They won't be able to "patch them up" later.  It's
nice to think that viruses have a bright side: forcing programs,
professional standards and hardware to improve.

Subject: Washington Post article (Army Virus Contract)

For possible interest, I'm forwarding the following article from yesterday's
Washington Post:

        The Washington Post, Wednesday, May 23, 1990
        By:  Evelyn Richards

        Army Scouting to Enlist Aid of Computer Virus

             Wanted:  Experienced computer hackers capable of breaking
        into enemy software systems and destroying secret files.
        Knowledge of computer viruses a must.
             Such a solicitation may not be that far fetched, considering
        the latest contract being put up for grabs by the U.S. Army.
        its secretive Center for Signals Warfare in Warrenton, Va., is
        seeking bids from businesses to study the feasibility of
        disabling enemy weapons systems by infecting them with
        disruptive computer programs.
             "We're looking to see if we can develop some malicious
        software concepts...[to] use against some adversary's command and
        control system," said Richard Poisel, the Army center's chief of
        research and technology.  He called the bid solicitation an
        effort to find businesses that could help in the "research
        effort," though he admitted it could draw a few run-of-the-mill
        hackers.
             In particular, the Army hopes to explore the use of so-
        called computer viruses--a type of unwanted software program that
        can propagate undetected from one computer to another, thwarting
        the computers' normal functions and sometimes garbling date.
        Incidents of computer sabotage have swept the country in recent
        months as hackers become increasingly efficient at breaking into
        the systems of businesses, universities and research centers.
             But what the Army envisions would be far trickier for your
        average hacker to pull off.  The biggest obstacle would be
        figuring out how to implant the enemy systems with the dreaded
        software.
             One answer suggested by the Army is to somehow transmit the
        malicious software code over radio waves.  It apparently figures
        that the troublemaking software could be inadvertently accepted
        by an adversary's system as it was receiving other information
        over the air.
             But some computer experts say the concepts borders on the
        absurd, in part because  such communications systems would likely
        contain elaborate schemes to protect against intrusions.  Also,
        altering software requires an intimate knowledge of how it
        operates under normal conditions, something that the United
        States would be unlikely to have in hand for a rival's system.
        And most military computer system cannot be reprogrammed by
        remote control.
             "It's equivalent to walking up to an arcade game and
        changing the programs of the game ... with the joystick," said
        William Murray, a computer security consultant who works with
        Deloitte & Touche in Connecticut.
             Not everyone is convinced the idea is so far-fetched.
             Myron Cramer, an electronic warfare specialist at Booz,
        Allen & Hamiltion Inc. in Bethesda, sees a day when viruses could
        be remotely injected into enemy computers that support air
        defense and battlefield control systems, lurking there covertly
        until they spring into action.  He even has described an
        "assassin" virus that could wreak widespread havoc and then erase
        itself, leaving no trail behind.
             Some experts also believe that evaluating such possibilities
        could help the United States plug its own vulnerabilities to
        computer disruptions.  Indeed, some computer specialists who were
        told of the Army's proposal said that the Untied States, more
        than any other power, is prone to be a victim of malicious
        software.
             "In any kind of environment where you'd want to set
        something like that loose, our forces would likely be more
        vulnerable than anyone we would be up against," said Eugene
        Spafford, a Purdue University professor who specializes in
        computer security.  "We have more computers and ours are more
        homogeneous than what others would be running."
             Is the Army, by soliciting such research, encouraging
        computer tempering in the commercial world?  Poisel doesn't think
        so.  "The Army developed the M-16 gun for military uses but
        certainly would discourage the private sector from using [it],"
        he said.  "It's not really an issue."

Subject: Viruses checker (PC)

        This is a reply to Anne Wittke's question about viruses checkers, due
this information might be of interest for more subscribers I decided to
post it to the list.
        I recently loaded a file named FPROT109.UUE from SIMTEL20. The file
contains an ARC file that is expanded to a number of programs for checking
disks and memory against trojans and viruses. It also contains a text file
with a description of a number of viruses. The programs are pretty new (
April 1990).
        SIMTEL's adress is: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET or wsmr-simtel20.army.mil
for InterNet (ftp).

I'm embarrassed.  And "pseudo-learned."  I was sure that I remembered
that "slime, poison" was Latin "virus (long i), virus (long i & u)",
in the fourth Latin declension of nouns.  [The first form is
nominative singular, the second is genitive singular, and determines
which declen- sion the word is in.]  This was partly because there
already is a "vir, viri (long second i)" in the second declension.  It
turns out that the word "virus (long i)" is also in the second
declension, confusingly enough.  That means that the genitive
singular, nominative plural, and accusative plural are all "viri (both
long i's)".

Confusing?  I agree (I guess obviously).  "Viri" is a valid Latin
plural for "virus" (not "virii").  It doesn't quite sound right in
English, though.  I'll just vote for "viruses" and leave it at that.

English is a living language.  Things like the plural of "virus" will,
ultimately, be determined by what people want to use and do use, not
pedantry such as I've been playing with.

while i was working at amdahl (on UTS, amdahl's Unix), i could quite
readily have put my time into developing a virus.  i spent quite a bit
of time on test domains where i effectively had the whole machine to
myself (booting, supervisor state, etc.).  while i was developing
standalone software, i could have just as easily split my time with
developing standalone viruses.  of course i was doing UTS development,
but i could have brought up MVS or VM instead.

but anyway, why should that be necessary?  there have been several
examples of Unix viruses, and a couple VMS viruses.  wasn't there even
something on Bitnet (i'm not sure)?  i suspect that MVS and VM have
*more* holes than Unix, for the simple reason that there are less
people around looking for holes to exploit.  far fewer people have
access to the source, or machines that run it.  they cost more than $1
million each, after all.

it was my understanding that any user could crash VM quite easily by
simply filling up all the spooling space--i don't think even unix is
that fragile.  and, while VM has a number of "security" or privilege
levels, once you get a step beyond the joe-user level (class G?) its
supposed to be easy to all the way to root (class A?).  i don't know
how, though; i was never very interested.

there's nothing magical about MVS or VM, after all.

Subject: How to reset CMOS configuration that prevents booting?

I've managed to do something truly bizarre to my computer. :)

I have a '386 motherboard with lots of Chips and Technologies stuff on
it. At boot time, I have the option to run setup/extended setup. While
trying to do something, I managed to alter the settings in 'extended
setup' part (the bits in various 'C&T CMOS registers') in such a
manner that the machine will no longer boot; when I reset it, it goes
beep-beep-beep pause beep-beep-beep...

Of course my initial reaction was to try to disconnect the battery and
let the CMOS memory clear itself; alas, it doesn't seem to be possible
on this motherboard!!! (Or at least I don't see how). It's got a
10-year rechargeable battery that's evidently soldered to the board.
Whatever skimpy documentation there is does not deal with the question
of disconnecting the battery.

Does anyone have any suggestions at all??? This is a fascinating
problem, variants of this have been undoubtedly discussed here in the
past (what would happen if the configuration settings were damanged
not ny the bumbling owner, but by a malevolent Trojan Horse; what
would happen if you forgot the password on a PS/2). I will not be able
to reach the person who sold me the board until Monday, and I'm wide
open for suggestions.

A computer-virus monitoring center has been established in Beijing by the

dubbed Jerusalem had seriously affected a large number of computers. According
to the Science and Technology Daily in Beijing, hundreds of computers in China
have been infected by one or more of six viruses: Jerusalem, Vienna, Brain,
648, Hemp and Yankee-Doodle. The viruses have damaged programs and deleted
stored information.

Come on, this is *stupid*! You have a perfectly regular, English plural
form ("viruses") which even a foreigner like I can get right at the
first attempt. Then some misguided people, who have learned that some
words take a Latin plural (like "nucleus - nuclei"), incorrectly assume
that *all* words of Latin origin *must* have plural forms ending in an "i".
Then some guy gets it even wronger and inserts an extra "i" (changing
the pronounciation to viree-i in the process). Then you come along and
say that you actually *prefer* the incorrect plural, even though you
know it's incorrect!

Where will this end? What if I were to suggest that
'Just in this newsgroup, where we are free to make any definitions we like,
we should use the plural "computeri" instead of "computers", 'cause I like
the sound better'?

Do we really *have* to make things more complicated than they already are?
English is sufficiently difficult to learn *without* having to memorize a
lot of ridiculous homemade plurals like "virii"! We really ought to
do our best to make communication easier, not more difficult.

Also, even if you personally will use the form "virii" only inside
this "small group of people" (comp.virus), a lot of the readers of
this group will assume (quite naturally) that "virii" is the correct
form - 'after all, lots of highly educated people seem to be using it,
don't they?' Then they will go to their doctor and talk about 'flu
virii' or whatever and get laughed at (possibly).

Finally, you ought to remember that if you use the form "virii" when
talking to someone outside this group, you risk getting one of the
following two unpleasant responses:

1) If the person you're speaking to doesn't know Latin, he/she will just
think that you're a snob who uses Latin plurals to show off - "Ha ha - I know
Latin plurals and you don't"

2) If you're speaking to someone who knows Latin, he/she will think
'What an idiot - trying to make an impression by using a Latin form without
 knowing that it's incorrect'

And I suppose that's not really the impression you want to make, is it?

Showing off superior knowledge by using fancy foreign phrases is not
very nice. If you have to do it, be sure to do it correctly. Otherwise,
people may think you're not only a snob, but a half-educated snob as well.

[Sure, I know I'm going to get flamed for this. It'll be kind of interesting...

[Ed. Heavy sigh...  This topic does come up from time to time (as many
of you are (painfully) aware), and it *always* leads to much heated
discussion.  My feelings are thus: what does it matter?  Does anyone
*not* know that you mean "the plural of virus" when you say "viruses"
*or* "virii"?!  I say use whatever you feel the most comfortable with,
and end this perpetual debate on the correctness of the plural.  This
isn't, after all, GRAMMER-L or LATIN-L.  So, unless I hear strong
objections (well-founded ones at that...), I'm going to forward all
subsequent discussions on this matter to /dev/null.

LZEXE is not an archiver.  LZEXE is a program that compresses an .EXE

I've always felt that networks are less likely to transmit viruses
than floppy disks because it is more likely that the culprit will be
caught.  I grant that games can be played with the signatures, etc.,
but chances are that some sort of log files are kept by the system
administrators about what came in, and when.  Although difficult, in a
crisis there is at least some hope that the dissemination path used by
the virus can be discovered.  Although not foolproof, this should act
as somewhat of a deterrent to virus writers.

Floppy disks are almost untraceable since they carry *no* copy history,
*no* history of what machines they visited and almost no means of
identifying the offender.

Hello All,

	I am doing research in non-US viruses. I am compiling a list
for comparison.  I have all the information I need on US viruses, but
my information is limited on overseas viruses.  Can someone help me?
Contact me directly please at

If you are losing your voice explaining to normal people how to get
rid of and avoid viruses on their Macs, perhaps the following document
will help.  Please feel free to steal from it shamelessly ("Lesser
artists borrow, great artists steal." - Igor Stravinsky) to write
your own document, or just use it as it is.

First I include the plain, virtually unformated text of my "Guide to
Fighting Macintosh Viruses:  Instructions for the Rest of Us".  To
this I attach the PostScript version of "Guide to Fighting Macintosh
Viruses:  Instructions for the Rest of Us".   It is a three page
illustrated set of instructions on how end-user type folks can fight
Macintosh viruses.

Good luck and happy hunting.

This is just a really quick note for virus trackers...

Stoned is everywhere!  It has been around the campus of the University
of Ottawa, Canada, for quite a while.  The worst part is, it keeps showing up.

On top of this, I know of a few friends who have been infected from sources
other than our campus.  The Stone is still rolling...

'ello.

I just took some time to try out Len Levine's FILETEST and Ted Emigh's
FILECRC, and I have a question.  Is there a *public domain* CRC package
out there that strikes a balance between these two?

FILECRC either checks the whole disk (60M would take a loooong time)
or limits only to *.EXE, *.COM, *.SYS, and *.BAT (which catches most,
but I'd like to be able to check *.OBJ, *.LIB, and other executables
as well).  FILETEST is basically a rewrite of FILECRC that allows an
input file to the program so that you can specify particular files to
check, but each must be specified by full name (i.e., no *, ?).

I took a look at the source code included, and it wouldn't be hard to
add the code for OBJs, OVLs, etc. into FILECRC.  I wanted to see if
there was already a package out (*or* a more recent revision to the above--
I have FILETEST release March '88, FILECRC release August '88) before I
went mucking around with customizing it.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Subject: SCANRES and VSHIELD give parity error. (PC)

I have been experimenting recently with McAfee's SCANRES and VSHIELD
programs and some of them in certain machines give a parity error
before ending the RAM scan thereby hangin up the machine. Specifically
I have tried SCANRES Version 42 and Version 61 and VSHIELD Version
62B. Version 42 of SCANRES works perfectly but Version 61 and 62B
(VSHIELD) present the mentioned problem on two machines. The machines
are: (1) an AT clone with 512K on a DTK motherboard, 4.5M of extended
memory, and DTK Version 3.11 BIOS, and (2) a Brazilian XT clone with
(coincidentaly) 512K memory. The motherboard memory size may not be
significant since yet a third XT clone (also Brazilian) with 512K
presents no problems.

Has anyone else seen this problem? Does anyone have an idea of what is
going on? Is this a BIOS problem?

Subject: Manual Stone Killer (PC)

This is the documentation for the manipulation of DEBUG utility to destroy the
stone virus. (For people like me who can't get a hold on any software, whether
it is free or not)

The stone virus has a characteristic of moving the boot sector system files
into either sector 7 or sector 2. It then replaces sector 1 with the virus.
When destroying the virus, it should be *first* terminated from it's memory
resident mode. This is to prevent further infection.

"Vstop" does this well.( I believe it is from PCTOOLS ) or booting from a
clean floppy.

****************************************************************************

To manually destroy the virus, use DEBUG, provided by DOS.

command summary:

- -a XXXX performs an assembling of lines beginning at XXXXh.
- -d XXXX performs a display of the buffer beginning from XXXXh.
- -t executes line by line showing all registers and status flags.
- -p executes the procedure
- -u XXXX unassembles the code beginning from XXXXh
- -RIP reset instruction pointer

The following program is used to read/write from a sector on a harddisk/floppy.

100     mov BX,0200 /* storing in buffer location 200 onwards */
        mov AH,2    /* 2 = read, 3 = write */
        mov AL,1    /* number of sectors = 1 */
        mov CL,1    /* start sector = 1 or 7 for reading the moved system file*
/
        mov CH,0    /* head number = 0 (normal)*/
        mov DL,80   /* 80 = harddisk, 0 = floppy A */
        mov DH,0    /* 00 always ?? */
        int 13      /* disk operation using BIOS ROM */
        NOP         /* No Operation ?? */
        int 20      /* Halt entire process */

Caution must be used to copy sectors to and fro the buffer. It would be
advisable to copy the infected sector into a floppy before anything else
is done. This is to ensure that the system can be restored to its infected
OPERATIONAL state *in case* restoration goes wrong. Otherwise your data will
have a "DMA channel to heaven".

All that is required for the destruction of the stone virus is to retreive the
system files from sector 7 (most likely) and write it into sector 1 of the
stone program. My advise is to constantly check what is in your defined buffer.

************** Better safe than sorry ****************************************

*******************************************************************************
This documentation is dated 30 May 1990 - Project Virus/ stone killer. If
anyone finds gross errors in the code, please alert the distribution list.
All attempts to kill the virus with this method are done at the owner's risk.

By the way, I don't think 1.2 Meg floppies can be saved.
