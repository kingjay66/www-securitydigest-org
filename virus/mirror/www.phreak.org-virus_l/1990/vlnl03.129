Virus Summary Listing

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: 639K, 640K ?? (PC)

I suggest that the folks who are concerned about the fact that one some
machine only 639K is reported, should read the document of UNVIRUS 9.
It is speicifically written there:

- ------------------------ Beginning -------------------------------------------

   Note: On some machines (e.g. PS/2, HP Vectra), IMMUNE (and CHKDSK) will
report less memory than is nominally available.  For example, on a PS/2 with
640K, IMMUNE will report only 639K even when no virus is present.  This is due
to an extended BIOS area.  In order to be certain that the deficiency is not du
e
to a virus, perform IMMUNE immediately after booting from your original (write-
protected) DOS diskette.  If you find only 639K you know that the missing 1K is
not due to a virus, and that 639 is the parameter which should be supplied to
IMMUNE.

- ------------------------ End -------------------------------------------------

I guess that IMMUNE uses address 0:413h to determine the amound of memory and
that Scan uses a different way. That's why people were a bit confused here.

Hope I helped someone..

Subject: Multi-platform virus scanning

        I was wondering about the feasability of say, for example,
writing a program for MS-DOS which checks, say, Amiga programs for
viruses (using strings, of course).  It seems like any platform should
be able to scan the files of any other.  On the Drew Underground BBS
(201-377-4065) for example, we have Mac and Amiga files, even though
we run under MS-DOS (soon to be PC-MOS).  Being able to scan the Amiga
files would be useful, or the Mac files, or whatever.  I'm sure there
are other systems or BBS'es that would benefit from this as well.
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw this out for discussion.

Just for the record, the first report in Virus-L of a sighting of the
4096 (albeit not explicitly by that name) was in Vol. 2, Issue 214:

  As for the debate between Ray Glath and John McAfee over whether the
recent Dallas sighting was the first documented case in the U.S., I
don't have any evidence either way.  But IMHO it was very incautious
of Ray to make such an extreme claim without proof, and one of the
most obvious sources of counter-evidence would have been John McAfee.
  Perhaps the problem is that Ray is using the word "documented" in a
very peculiar way.  At one point he seems to imply that a virus sight-
ing hasn't been documented unless it has been reported on Virus-L.
Whatever his definition is, he should have stated it in his original
posting.

If the anti virus programs would first perform a checksum, then
couldn't a virus "outsmart" that program by just changing one (non

I can log in to the system, cwd and ls around its file system, but the

I don't have such problems with other systems - but in the mean time I
would like to know if I can go elsewhere to get it.

Subject: Further 4096 Information (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
=============================================================

	Ray Glath apparently had some concerns about my posting on
4096 infections here in the States.  Clearly, more information is in
order.  Ray had trouble verifying any earlier infections and stated
that no-one that he contacted at Burger King or the Monterey Computer
user's Group had any information about 4096 infections.  William
Abbot, office manager for Burger King's northern California franchises
has graciously given me permission to post his phone number, and so
has John Blankford of PC People in Monterey.  They would be more than
happy to discuss their experiences with anyone wishing to find out
what it's like to get a 4096 infection.  William can be reached at 408
375 5464, and John can be reached at 408 649 5900.  There are dozens
of other 4096 infection contacts we would be glad to share with Mr.
Glath if he wishes to contact us or the CVIA.
	Mr. Glath also berated me for not answering David Chess's
Virus-L posted request for information about 4096 infections.  I
speak with Mr. Chess many times each week, and sometimes multiple
times a day, and it is easier for me to orally transmit information
to him than to write it down and forward it.  As Dave will attest,
I spoke with him the day after his posting, asked him what
information he was looking for and imparted what information I had.
Repeating it to him through a Virus-L posting did not seem at the
time to be a priority item.
	In a private posting to me, Mr. Glath inferred that I was
attempting to claim that I was the first to discover the 4096
virus.  If I imparted that impression to anyone else, then I must
apologize.  I made no claim to discovery.  I merely claimed to be
aware of the presence and movement of the virus here in the States.

Subject: On reporting infections to VALERT-L and VIRUS-L

This subject comes up here and in private conversation from time to
time, so I'm going to open the can of worms...  :-)

Should we or should we not be reporting virus infections and other
related information?  And, if so, how much information is enough?  I
don't really know if I have the right answers to those questions, but
I'll try to address them by giving you folks my personal _opinions_ on
the matters.

I believe that it is useful to publicly report major virus sightings
in a forum such as this (and/or VALERT-L) - to a degree, at least.
Obviously, if we were reporting every infection of the Jerusalem B
virus, things would get rather boring (not to mention the wasted
network bandwidth).  However, major infections of new viruses, such as
with this business regarding the 4096 in the States, may be worthwhile
to report.  I believe that there are folks out there (please correct
me if I'm wrong) who would want to know some basic information
regarding major changes in events such as this.  By "basic
information", I'm referring to geographic location, number of
infections, number of sites, and (when possible/allowable/appropriate)
names.  My feelings are that this type of information would supply
administrators with useful "heads-up" warnings.  This is the sort of
thing that I believe VALERT-L is ideally suited for (with re-postings
going to VIRUS-L/comp.virus).

Now, I'm not collecting statistics on these things, and I do know that
there are folks who are doing just that.  What sort of information
would you folks like to have?  How about other people, like system
administrators, would you find the above info valuable?

Subject: Problems running Disinfectant 2.0! (Mac)

     Hi,

	First off I want to thank the people who responded to my plea for
      help with the 4096 virus.  Things are under control now.  I have another
      problem though.  I've downloaded Disinfectant 2.0 and cannot use the
      help function on my machine.  I have an SE/30 with 4mb of memory.  The
      program will scan and disinfect fine but when you try to call up help
      the machine freezes and I have to re-boot.  I have many INIT's, CDEV's
      and DA's in my system folder.  Could these be causing this?  I also
      have a startup screen and various other things in my system folder.

	Does anybody know of anything that could cause this. It works fine
      on other machines so I know it has to be my computer.  I have so much
      going on in the system folder I don't know (or have time) to remove
      things one by one to test them.   Any help will be appreciated.

	Does somebody known if there was some cases of
viral infection that came through other than floppy exchange
and data interchange over Internet ? I think to other networks,
through atmospheric radio transmissions, magnetic induction, ...

Subject: Re: Dangerous virus removal programs

Some of my thoughts of the subject...

mweiner@bene.at.eu.net (Michael Weiner) writes:

>position, taking bytes from a certain offset within the viral code and
>copying them to the beginning of the program in my opinion is

Well, how are we then supposed to disinfect files ?  Just replacing infected
programs with originals may be preferable, and even necessary in three or
four cases, where the virus destroys the original program, but the originals
are not always available.

The disinfector program can do various things to ensure that the bytes written
back to the file are in fact the bytes the virus would copy, for example
checking the presence of the "restore old program" code within the virus.
Example:

        Suppose that a virus just overwrites the first 3 bytes of a .COM
        file with a JMP to the virus code and restores the original code with
        the following sequence of instructions.

	MOV   BX,100H           ; beginning of program
        MOV   AX,[SI+357]       ; location of original data
	MOV   [BX],AX           ; restore first two bytes
        MOV   AL,[SI+359]       ; get third byte
        MOV   [BX+2],AL         ; and restore it

A disinfection program may check if this code fragment is indeed present at
a specific location, and if so, the original 3 bytes can savely be written
back to the beginning of the file.

>We will experience a LOT of viruses that will carry identical signatures

Just what do you mean by "identical signatures" ?  Even if a part of the code
is identical, another part may be different, so another set of signatures may
not match.  A scanning program should not use just a single signature for
any virus.

>Perfect agreement with that - but it could even get worse: Imagine
>virus derivates deliberately placing JMPs to killer code within their
>body at the location where a recovery program expects the original
>start of the program.

As soon as this happened, the virus would probably be sent to the author of
the anti-virus program, who could then update his program to deal with the
new virus.  After all, new versions of anti-virus programs get distributed a
lot faster than new virus variants.

>Consequences would be disastrous because viruses could be 'tailormade' to
>certain anti-virus programs.

Anti-virus programs are always changing, and as long as we have several
popular programs, it is impractical to attack them all in this way.
It has been attempted of course, one virus attacks the programs by Vesselin
Bontchev, and another one attacks Flushot+ and Bombsquad.

>To wrap it up, removal of a virus should ONLY be performed by a
>program if it has found a virus and identified ALL it's code (not just
>some short part of the code).

This is becoming more and more difficult, as the number of self-modifying,
encrypting viruses increases.  It seems this group now includes four viruses,
Stealth (1260), V-101, Suomi (1008) and Flip.  I was not even able to produce a
16-byte identification string for the Virus bulletin in those cases, without
using "don't care" characters.
