Subject: Possible Virus (Mac)

One of the public computer labs here is having trouble with it's system
disks.  For some reason, space on these disks is lost.  There are
no other files added to the disks and the file sizes of the orginal
files have not changed.  Could something be changing the number of free
blocks without actually allocating them?
The files that are on the system disk are:
   System 6.0.4               LaserWriter
   Finder                     Monitors
   Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.1       Sound
   Gatekeeper 1.1.1           StartupScreen
   Clipboard File
   Color
   General
   ImageWriter
   Key Layout
   Keyboard
   LaserPrep
We have Gatekeeper set so that it does not use the log feature.

Subject: possible new trojan on Genie (Mac)

        a rumour has reached me that a program called "Totally Safe Sex"
        on Genie may be a new trojan.

        if you download(ed) it, be most careful - my rumour says that
        it destroys the Finder and makes your System file grow suspiciously.
        if you *must* run it, do it with all hard disks disconnected,
        and best only with a RAMdisk ...

        if someone has access to Genie and would send me a copy, I'd
        appreciate it (no later than Monday, please.  by Monday evening
        a Fedexed copy will have reached me)

Subject: Getting files from "anonymous FTP"

Information from "Kenneth R. van Wyk" <krvw@edu.cmu.sei.cert>, with thanks.
Some Virus-L messages say that the rest of the message can be got (say) "by
anonymous ftp from  the/quick/brown/fox/jumps.over.the.lazy.dog".  For  the
information  of those not very conversant with FTP, this can be done thus:-

Type your computer's command "ftp cert.sei.cmu.edu". "cert.sei.cmu.edu"  is
a  USA email address. It should be "edu.cmu.sei.cert@uk.ac.nsfnet-relay" if
typed in UK (I think).
When asked for the remote username, type "anonymous".
When asked for the remote password, type anything non-null.
When you get your computer's FTP command's "ftp>" prompt  (or  equivalent),
type these commands, splitting the given filename at its last '/':-

     cd the/quick/brown/fox
     get jumps.over.the.lazy.dog
     quit

If you type the command "dir" before the command "quit", you will also  get
a directory-listing of filenames.
If you type the command "help" before the "quit", you will get information.

Subject: Re: Virus management software

We at Monmouth just completed our defense against the STONED virus
using the VIRUSCAN and CLEAN from McAfee.  It certainly simplified
our efforts.  Before learning of the CLEAN program we had to do
a LOW level format.  Now we have it built in to the startup to prevent
future spreading.  We found McAfee (I spoke to John) extremely helpful.
Monmouth plans on supporting the SHAREWARE as soon as budget permits.

Subject: Virus project - sources and information needed

     I am a computer science major at the Johns Hokpins University
who is planning a programming project on anti-viral utilities
(genralized infection detection, to be specific).  I would greatly
appreciate any and ALL sources (i.e., books, periodicals, online
publications, FTP sites, and papers - especially theses like Fred
Cohen's) that anyone could recommend to me.  The options I am exploring
are:

1)  A Macintosh-based virus infection detector which combines aspects
of Disinfectant with a more general protection scheme which halts
unauthorized interrupts from unidentified sources, including unknown
potential virii.  This would first be required to work on WDEF;
afterwards, I would test it on post-WDEF virii as they appear.

2)  The same idea, applied to the 80286/386.  Advantages of using the
IBM systems, besides the fact that virii are much more prevalent on
them, include the availability of technical information on 286/386
assembly and interrupts.  I haven't looked at Inside Macintosh very
closely yet, so I am uncertain as to the relative difficulty level
of programming the Macintosh toolbox.

3)  (A long shot, probably not feasible).  Investigation of UNIX
and/or VAX system vulnerabilities, from the perspective of an
infiltration device (e.g., the infamous Internet '88 worm).  This
would entail a study on aspects of Morris' composite creation, along
with speculation concerning techniques NOT used by the worm (but which
were suggested by Donn Seeley in _A Tour of the Worm_).

     Any suggestions are welcome; please address mailed responses to:
HSU_WH@JHUVMS.HCF.JHU.EDU or HSU_WH@JHUNIX.HCF.JHU.EDU - also, please
post general information which may benefit the other two prospective
paper authors.  Thank you.

P.S. : Could someone please E-Mail me with information on subscribing
to RISKS and Virus-L?  Thanks again.

I've never heard of it leaving permanent damage to the monitor; if
this is what I think it is, the problem is in the sprite registers.
If it's the moving graphics that are being scrambled, this is probably
what's occurring.  Just load up Preferences and move the screen a
little to the right or left until it corrects itself.

Excuse me for my apparent cluelessness but could someone please tell me what
people mean by Hamming?  From context I think I know what ever one is talking
about but a quick definition (or something) would be very helpful.

Thanks in advance.

To all virus experts,
     One of our systems here at SAKFU00 was infected by the STONED virus.
     I remember that I read a note about how to remove this virus from a
     hard disk ,but the writer was refering to some issues of COMPUTER
     & SECURITY which we were not able to get.
     If any of you knows step by step instructions to remove that virus,He
     (or she) will be thankfull to send it to me directly or to the list.

Subject: Using PD CRC programs and Scanners on LANs (PC)

In Virus-L, v3.i59, Jim Molini gives an alternative to having to register
many copies of shareware programs for virus detection.  He suggests using
a PD CRC checker (eg, FILETEST by Len Levine) to monitor program changes,
and use your one registered copy of a scanner/disinfector if any changes are
detected.

I looked at SIMTEL20, and they have FILETEST available in directory
pd:<msdos.trojan-pro> under FILETEST.ARC.  Also available there is FILE-CRC,
another PD CRC program; there are several others around I'm sure.

We (at Wayne State) have a similar problem to the one he's addressing.
We are starting an IBM token-ring LAN, with Ethernet, and will be running
Novell.  There will be several workstations hooked up to a server.  Some will
be used for a special program involving teaching kids (high school age) how
to use PCs and word processors, database programs, spreadsheets, etc.
Development on these machines will not be an issue.  However, our Engineering
department also intends to use some of the workstations as well, and they
may very well do a fair amount of program development.

Jim, would you suggest the same approach for a network where there may be
heavy programming?  I'd like to see some more discussion of this topic.
I've also seen mention of PCDATA, PC Magazines PD antiviral package.  I
don't have any experience with it - has anybody used it and can you give
some evaluation of how it works?  Would this be a reasonable alternative
given our situation?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions,

CA-90:02
                            CERT Advisory
                            March 19, 1990
                      Internet Intruder Warning
-
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been a number of media reports stemming from a March 19 New York
Times article entitled 'Computer System Intruder Plucks Passwords and
Avoids Detection.'  The article referred to a program that attempts to
get into computers around the Internet.

At this point, the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination
Center (CERT/CC) does not have hard evidence that there is such a
program.  What we have seen are several persistent attempts on systems
using known security vulnerabilities.  All of these vulnerabilities
have been previously reported.  Some national news agencies have
referred to a 'virus' on the Internet; the information we have now
indicates that this is NOT true.  What we have seen and can confirm is
an intruder making persistent attempts to get into Internet systems.

It is possible that a program may be discovered.  However, all the
techniques used in these attempts have also been used, in the past, by
intruders probing systems manually.

As of the morning of March 19, we know of several systems that have
been broken into and several dozen more attempts made on Thursday and
Friday, March 15 and 16.

Systems administrators should be aware that many systems around the
Internet may have these vulnerabilities, and intruders know how to
exploit them.  To avoid security breaches in the future, we recommend
that all system administrators check for the kinds of problems noted
in this message.

The rest of this advisory describes problems with system
configurations that we have seen intruders using.  In particular, the
intruders attempted to exploit problems in Berkeley BSD derived UNIX
systems and have attacked DEC VMS systems.  In the advisory below,
points 1 through 12 deal with Unix, points 13 and 14 deal with the VMS
attacks.

If you have questions about a particular problem, please get
in touch with your vendor.

The CERT makes copies of past advisories available via anonymous FTP
(see the end of this message).  Administrators may wish to review
these as well.

We've had reports of intruders attempting to exploit the following
areas:


1) Use TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to steal password files.

   To test your system for this vulnerability, connect to your system
using TFTP and try 'get /etc/motd'.  If you can do this, anyone else
can get your password file as well.  To avoid this problem, disable
tftpd.

   In conjunction with this, encourage your users to choose passwords
that are difficult to guess (e.g. words that are not contained in any
dictionary of words of any language; no proper nouns, including names
of "famous" real or imaginary characters; no acronyms that are common
to computer professionals; no simple variations of first or last
names, etc.)  Furthermore, inform your users not to leave any clear
text username/password information in files on any system.

   If an intruder can get a password file, he/she will usually take it
to another machine and run password guessing programs on it. These
programs involve large dictionary searches and run quickly even on slow
machines.  The experience of many sites is that most systems that do
not put any controls on the types of passwords used probably have at
least one password that can be guessed.


2) Exploit accounts without passwords or known passwords (accounts
with vendor supplied default passwords are favorites).  Also uses
finger to get account names and then tries simple passwords.

   Scan your password file for extra UID 0 accounts, accounts with no
password, or new entries in the password file.  Always change vendor
supplied default passwords when you install new system software.


3) Exploit holes in sendmail.

   Make sure you are running the latest sendmail from your vendor.
BSD 5.61 fixes all known holes that the intruder is using.


4) Exploit bugs in old versions of FTP; exploit mis-configured
   anonymous FTP

   Make sure you are running the most recent version of FTP which is
the Berkeley version 4.163 of Nov.  8 1988.  Check with your vendor
for information on configuration upgrades.  Also check
your anonymous FTP configuration.  It is important to follow the
instructions provided with the operating system to properly configure
the files available through anonymous ftp (e.g., file permissions,
ownership, group, etc.).  Note especially that you should not use your
system's standard password file as the password file for FTP.


5) Exploit the fingerd hole used by the Morris Internet worm.

   Make sure you're running a recent version of finger.  Numerous
Berkeley BSD derived versions of UNIX were vulnerable.


Some other things to check for:

6) Check user's .rhosts files and the /etc/hosts.equiv files for systems
outside your domain.  Make sure all hosts in these files are
authorized and that the files are not world-writable.


7) Examine all the files that are run by cron and at.  We've seen
intruders leave back doors in files run from cron or submitted to at.
These techniques can let the intruder back on the system even after
you've kicked him/her off.  Also, verify that all files/programs
referenced (directly or indirectly) by the cron and at jobs, and the
job files themselves, are not world-writable.


8) If your machine supports uucp, check the L.cmds file to see if
they've added extra commands and that it is owned by root (not by uucp!)
and world-readable.  Also, the L.sys file should not be world-readable
or world-writable.


9) Examine the /usr/lib/aliases (mail alias) file for unauthorized
entries.  Some alias files include an alias named 'uudecode'; if this
alias exists on your system, and you are not explicitly using it, then
it should be removed.


10) Look for hidden files (files that start with a period and are
normally not shown by ls) with odd names and/or setuid capabilities,
as these can be used to "hide" information or privileged (setuid root)
programs, including /bin/sh.  Names such as '..  ' (dot dot space
space), '...', and .xx have been used, as have ordinary looking names
such as '.mail'.  Places to look include especially /tmp, /usr/tmp,
and hidden directories (frequently within users' home directories).


11) Check the integrity of critical system programs such as su, login,
and telnet.  Use a known, good copy of the program, such as the
original distribution media and compare it with the program you are
running.


12) Older versions of systems often have security vulnerabilities that
are well known to intruders.  One of the best defenses against
problems is to upgrade to the latest version of your vendor's system.


VMS SYSTEM ATTACKS:

13) The intruder exploits system default passwords that have not been
changed since installation.  Make sure to change all default passwords
when the software is installed.  The intruder also guesses simple user
passwords.  See point 1 above for suggestions on choosing good
passwords.

14) If the intruder gets into a system, often the programs
loginout.exe and show.exe are modified.  Check these programs against
the files found in your distribution media.


If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact CERT via
telephone or email.
