VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

  Another Loophole in SAM Intercept

  Folks:

We have discovered another loophole that can allow a person to bypass the
floppy scan in SAM intercept.

If you are in an application and want to open a file on a floppy, SAM
will scan the floppy you insert. If, however, while in the File Open
dialog box, you click on EJECT and insert another floppy, this floppy
(and any other subsequent floppies you insert) are not scanned by SAM.

This "loophole" in SAM would allow you to infect your unit if there is
a virus on the second or later floppies. Since most viruses go on to
infect the system files, SAM would pick up the infection the next time
you reboot your machine (provided you have configured your copy to
scan the system folder at startup)

We have notified Symantec of this loophole and would appreciate further
confirmation.

Subject: 4096 (PC)

          I have been surprised to the the excitement caused by this virus.
Admittedly, it uses some "stealth" techniques to hide itself, but the
"stealth" itself should be detectable in memory. Certainly a thorough virus
checking routine will not rely on DOS to provide accurate information. Next,
despite roumors of CMOS and Modem viruses, to be able to become resident in
an XT class machine, some memory MUST be used somewhere and this is detectable.

          Thus there are (at the moment) three checkpoints: either available
memory has been reduced, interrupts are being vectored into never-never land
(virus hiding in unassigned memory - note: this may not be obvious from the
interrupt table), or crashes will occur often as the virus is overwritten.
While I have not yet seen the 4096 (a copy is coming but not yet arrived),
I feel certain that it is detectable reasonably easily in memory - if not
directly then by its process of hiding. As soon as I determine an easy way to
detect it, the answer will be posted. In the meantime, booting from a write-
protected floppy and running a clean SCAN of version 53 or later is known
to be effective.

Subject: 453 Virus (PC)

          Otto Stolz was kind enough to forward to me a hex dump of
the 453 virus and the following information is now available:

1) Appender class, does not become resident.
2) Signature: The virus looks for 9090h as the last
   two bytes in a file, virus assumes infected if found & skips file.
3) Replication: Virus looks only for uninfected .COM files in current
   default directory
4) Trigger: None
5) Bomb: None
6) Evasion: None
7) Comments: Very crude structure with much unnecessary PUSHing & POPing.
   several places are noticed where more complex instructions could be
   used more efficiently. All calls are functions of Interrupt 21h. No
   trigger or bomb is present though numerous NOPs and extraneous JMPs
   provide plenty of space for addition.
8) Note: The apparent string "TUQ.RPVS" is simply a sequence of PUSH
   instructions rendered as ASCII.

A nice thought, but very impratical for the following reasons:

1) Many users of PC level products just want to load their systems and go. To
require them to compile and build their O/S would effectively eleminate their
ability to install the systems themselve. Thus a PC "expert" would come in and
do it. This could also lead to even more problems since this person COULD
insert whatever was desired and the user would probable not know the
difference.

2) The amount of time and effort to build an O/S cna be very long, especially
when one moves into the mini and mainframe arena. It takes almost 24 hours of
wall time to build OS-1100 for Unisys machines. I don't even want to think how
long it would take to compile and build MVS from source.

3) When you release source and the tools to build the O/S, local code WILL
creep into the O/S. Maintenance and upgrades become a royal pain, especially
when no one documents what they did. ["I know I will remember what I did two
years from now and why when we have to upgrade"].

4) O/S source is a trade secret for many vendors. (As one vendor found out
going against IBM)

Subject: Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.2 (Mac)

Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.2 has finally been released.  A short descrip-
tion of it and details of where it can be found are included
below.

Gatekeeper Aid is a Startup document (INIT) designed to auto-
matically hunt and kill all known strains of the WDEF virus, as
well as possible future strains and related viruses.  It should
be used to augment the Gatekeeper anti-virus system and may
also be used to augment other anti-virus tools.

Version 1.0.2 of Gatekeeper Aid is designed to correct a number
of problems that surfaced in version 1.0.1.  A complete list of
these problems is included in the documentation.  In addition,
version 1.0.2 improves Gatekeeper Aid's protections and adds
some new features including the ability to retroactively correct
a bug in existing versions of Gatekeeper that is responsible for
about 90% of all the Internal Errors reported.

Users of Gatekeeper Aid are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
this latest version.  Users of anti-virus systems that don't
automatically detect AND REMOVE the WDEF virus are strongly
encouraged to use Gatekeeper Aid to augment their current systems.

Also included with Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.2 is a document which pro-
vides a quick preview of Gatekeeper 2.0.

Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.2 has been posted to comp.binaries.mac and should
appear there relatively soon.  It will also be sent to the info-mac
archives at sumex.stanford.edu and to the simtel archives.  It is
immediately available in the microlib/mac/virus directory on
ix1.cc.utexas.edu and ix2.cc.utexas.edu (take your pick).

This will return the hard disk to it's origonal state (before RMJOSHI was
executed).

Be sure to boot off an unifected diskette before using these programs. Since
Joshi Virus redirects attempts to read or write to the virus, these programs
will not work if the virus is active in memory.

These programs may be used by anybody, as long as they are not modified or
used in another program...<MM>.

This is a forward from Aryeh Goretsky of the Computer Virus
Industry Association:
================================================================

Note:  Contact information from the following CVIA Membership Alert
has been removed from the posting, but has been submitted
separately to the Virus-L moderator.

August 6, 1990
CVIA Membership Alert
Originating Members:  [Information Removed]
Alert Type:  Initial Infection Spread
Library Entries:  AirCop; 1253; Leprosy
Entry Types:  Boot Sector; Multipartite; COM Infector

          The second U.S. occurence of the AirCop virus was reported
from Fremont, California on August 3.  The virus had infected a retail
software distributor on multiple machines.  The virus appears
identical to the original AirCop reported by Microsoft.  The virus was
traced back to a software duplicator in Taiwan.

          An unusual virus, called the 1253 virus, has been reported in
Austria and submitted to the CVIA library.  The virus infects COM
files, floppy diskette boot sectors, and hard disk partition tables.
Either of the three forms of the virus are sufficient to transfer an
infection to the other.  In its COM infector form, it increases the
size of infected files by 1253 bytes.  The virus activates on December
24th and corrupts all data on the hard disk and on any inserted
floppies.  An interim detector for the virus is available now to
liaison persons.

          The Leprosy virus has been reported at 11 separate sites in
Northern California within the past five days.  The outbreak appears
to stem from a file uploaded to bulletin boards within the Bay Area
called 486COMP.ZIP, which promises to compare the user's system to a
80486-based PC.  The Leprosy virus is a slow replicator and there is
little chance of contracting this virus ouside of the BBS channels or
from an intentional infection.  A detector is available, however, for
liaison persons if requested.

Subject: Viruscan Site Licensing

This is a forward from John McAfee:
==================================================================

          Brian Aslakson posted a Virus-L message concerning the cost
of service licenses for VIRUSCAN.  Just so there is no
misunderstanding, I'd like to point out the differences between our
service licenses and our site licenses.  Site licenses, for large
volume organizations, bottom out at $1.90 per machine.  They allow
the use on any machine in the licensed organization.  Service
licenses, on the other hand, are used by organizations that want
to license only a few copies, but want to carry those copies to
other organizations, or sites, and scan any and all machines at the
site.  A service organization may license, say, one copy, but use
the copy on hundreds of machines a day.  As a result, each service
copy of SCAN may generate multiple support calls to our office each
week, as viruses are detected and removal or containment assitance
is requested.  Support costs us time and money, but it is provided
at no charge to our clients.  Accordingly, our service licenses
cost more, per copy, than our site licenses.  Brian suggests that
$5,800 for 100 service copies is unreasonable.  I can't say.  The
folks on our support lines (and not a few of the users of SCAN),
however, seem to feel otherwise.
