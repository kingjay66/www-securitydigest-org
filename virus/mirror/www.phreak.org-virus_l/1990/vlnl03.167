I don't know if what I have is a virus, but once in a while my pc
clone will beep for seemingly no reason.  I've used numerous virus
scans, all came up negative.  Has anyone else had similar 'computer
posessions'?  This is VERY odd... any help would be appreciated!

Subject: Disk write loses 10 characters --- a virus? (PC)

stephenc@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu (Stephen Chung) asks if file writes
mysteriously losing the first 10 characters might be a virus.  It
certainly might!  The 9800:0000 virus (aka 1559) does that; I seem to
recall it does it whenever the month is Sept-Dec, although it might be
Oct-Dec.  Any good virus scanner should be able to find the infected
files for you, if that is indeed your problem.  Also just look for
files that are larger than they ought to be; it adds about 1559 bytes
to both COM and EXE files.  DC

I was a bit wary as his name was different to his account name so I
answered him:

The mail bounced with:

I then mailed the transcript to postmaster@rose with the following note:

>
> Is this person Don Sheffer genuine?  Note that he wants a virus!

Guy Middleton (the postmaster@rose) then replied:

>The message you received can be generated for a number of reasons.  The user

>There is no such thing as the "University of Waterloo Virus Response Team".

In summary:
1. Beware of genuine sounding people who want viruses for research
2. Beware of Don Sheffer
3. Beware of [employees!] of the University of Waterloo Virus Response Team

All versions of SAM (from 1.0 and on) have detected and repaired the
original ANTI virus. The new strain of ANTI, which many are calling
ANTI B, is not identified BY NAME by SAM 2.0. SAM's suspicious
activity monitor DOES catch this new strains's attempt to spread and
thus keep it from propagating. But to have SAM 2.0 identify ANTI B by
name, the virus definition posted earlier must be added to SAM
Intercept and Virus Clinic.

    Hello,

    I'm a novice at computer viruses, and need some information.  I
have a tandy computer with a 1200 baud modem, now the problem comes
with the modem.  I can't get it to make the final connection to a
remote computer.  I as using procomm 2.4.2, and it did work for a
period of time.  I've had the computer and modem in to be checked out
for clitches, nothing was found to be wrong with the hardware.  Has
anyone heard of a virus that can do this?  If so what can I do to kill
it?  Thanx for any info.

Subject: UK virus centre, Part 2

The saga continues,

Three routes are currently open to us within the UK to establish a virus
centre similar in remit to the University of Hamburg centre, with some
aspects of CERT's remit regarding mainframe system security and WAN/LAN
worm propagation, namely:

1. Submit a funding proposal under the Department of Trade and Industry
   Information engineering directorate project call in December.

2. Submit a collaborative proposal with other European partners for the
   EEC RACE malicious software grant proposal.

3. Organise a consortia of firms to directly fund such a centre or centres.

At the moment I am keen to continue with 1) in collaboration with Sophos,
S&S and NCS in the UK.

The centre would embrace all aspects of malicious software prevention,
analysis and detection, including:

a. Providing general advice and information bulletins on malicious software
   measures and on the trends in viral developments.

b. Centralisation of effort to disassemble and analyse malicious software
   (together with the provision of a repository of viral samples for
   product evaluation services).

c. Provision of a warning and bulletin service at two levels - 1) basic
   non-technical warnings via electronic media and popular computing
   publications of detected malicious software. 2) advanced information
   bulletins to specialist technical publications in the security field,
   and to organisations requiring detailed analysis.

d. Contact point for international information exchange on malicious
   software issues, in collaboration with similar organisations worldwide.

I will ask if Paul Evans (Computers and security) can arrange an
informal meeting of interested parties at Compsec. If you (personally)
or your organisation are interested in seeing this centre go ahead,
please contact me at Compsec 90, London.

My thanks to all who have indicated their support for this initiative.

Lets hope that the vast duplication of effort currently taking place
in analysing viruses and trojan horses can be avoided !!

This is an attempt at translation.  My German is a little rusty, and I am

Virus Update

Help against concealed viruses

The infamous 4096, alias Frodo, virus, resides in main memory
and because of that causes problems and is invisible to anti-virus utilities
(see Computer Woche 33, dated August 17 1990, page 10).
This virus has an Achilles heel - its own invisibility.  When an infected
program is copied, a combination of circumstances makes the copy virus free.
Prerequisites: the virus is resident in memory and the name extension of
the destination file is not an extension that indicates an executable file
(COM, EXE, OVL, or SYS).  In this case the virus, in order to keep itself
resident, filters its own code out of the byte stream.
The destination file receives only the original program code.  The best choice
to accomplish this procedure is a compression program like PKARC.  Whether
this works with the DOS programs COPY and XCOPY is currently unknown.
Immediately afterwards, the system must be booted from a diskette that is
known to be clean, and the copied file decompressed (with its original
extension).
However, virus experts warn against this "therapy".  Since it is not very
simple, only people who are experienced in working with their PCs at the bit
level should attempt it.  The safest solution is to use a professional
anti-virus program whose latest version is aware of this type of infection,
such as the virus scanner from Solomon (Findviru), McAffee (Scan), or
Skulason (F-Fehler).  The Turbo Anti Virus program from EPG International
can supposedly also remove it.
Two remarks:
Signature programs and virus scanners should only be run from a diskette that
is guaranteed to be clean, and only then after the PC has been booted from a
diskette that is also clean.
If the virus is still active, a program error does not produce the message
"Frodo Lives".  Instead, the computer hangs.

Help against "magic cape' viruses:

The infamous 4096 - alias the Frodo virus, mwhich resides
in the main memory and makes itself invisible to all
operational utilities (cf CW 33 of Aug. 17 1990 p. 10), has
an Achilles heel - namely the fact that it is invisible. When
copying an infected program, the copy is, under certain conditions,
virus-free. Precondition: the virus resides in the main memory
and the extensions or designations are not ones that
are normally executable (e.g. COM, EXE, OVL, OR SYS.) Then the
virus filters its code out of the byte flow in order to hide
itself.

Only the original program code arrives at the destination. The
best thing in this case is to use a compromise program like PKARC.
It's not yet certain to what extent it would work with DOS
programs COPY and XCOPY.
Afterwards the infected program has to be erased, the system
has to be booted with a definitely clean diskett, and the copies
have to be "decompromised" (?) and labelled with the correct
extensions.
Some virus experts issue warnings about this "therapy." Because
it's not as simple as it sounds, only those who are familiar
with their PC at bit-level should try it. The safest solution
is a professional anti-virus program. The newer ones recognize
the catalyst (irritant) right away, like, for instance, the
virus scanner by Solomon (Findviru) Mcaffee (Scan) or Skulason
(Find-mistake). The anti-virus turbo program by EPG
international is capable of getting rid of it, too.
Just two tips:
1. Signature programms and virus scanners should be started
only by a guaranteed clean diskett and only after the PC
has been booted from a diskett that's just as clean.
2. If the virus becomes active, it won't elicit the message
"Frodo Lives" because of a programm error. Instead, the
"counter" (computer?) disconnects.
