VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Defense Against Computer Viruses

After several months as a computer hermit and Virus-L parasite, I
guess it's time to sharpen up the old electronic writing stick and
join the fray again.  I owe this recurrence to Paul Furnanz (#171) and
Dave Grisham (#170) who asked for advice on virus defense.

Well, gentlemen, I am not very good at advice, but will you settle for an
opinion?

First, for all of those lost puppies who want to compare viruses to
living organisms (yes, I've still been reading all this time), let me
reiterate one of my earlier points:

Viruses are a computer INTEGRITY problem, nothing more.  The broader
issue of malicious code can be another story, but viruses violate
system integrity.  Let me elaborate.

A virus must modify some other EXECUTABLE resource on a computer
system to replicate.  If it doesn't modify another executable resource
and still replicates then it can obtain computer resources on its own.
This makes it a Worm.

If it doesn't replicate, it is not a virus, it is a Trojan Horse.  And
unfortunately, no one can protect you from yourself.

(If you want to know what is executable, please look up the Mar-May
issues of Virus-L.  We beat that horse to death back then.)

This is all fairly basic stuff that is traceable back to Cohen, et al.

So what does this mean to you the computer user?  It means that as
long as you can maintain the integrity of executable resources on your
computer system, you can protect yourself from virus infections.
Unfortunately, this is impossible to guarantee on most
micro-computers, so we are back to relative levels of risk and
effective detection.

Before I get too far off track, let me describe the approach taken
where I work.  We have over 6000 IBM PC compatibles on-site and
another 4-8000 in the local area.

All users who wish to obtain Public Domain software are encouraged to
download it from a BBS that we professionally maintain and register
all users for.  Every piece of software we put on the board is scanned
before it is placed in the download directories.  Nevertheless, we
also display a disclaimer that we are not perfect and users should be
careful.

Software is not routinely exchanged over networks, but data is.  We
recommend that users buy software when they need it and have "demo"
copies of most packages for users who want to test drive something.
This software and all PC's that run in the demonstration facility are
checked daily for viruses.  This does 2 things.  It makes users feel
safe when they come in to try out the software, and it allows us to
spot check user diskettes in case they are one of the walking wounded.

We have a reliable and organized method for reporting infections and
have done our best to tell users that getting infected is not a
criminal offense.  When an infection occurs, any user can call a
support desk and get expert assistance with the problem.  This also
applies to possible infections.

As a result, we have experienced an infection rate of less than 1 per
1000 PC's per year.  Most of those infections have involved some type
of shared machine.  Therefore we are increasing our virus surveillance
efforts around shared PC's and terminal areas.

Even though we do have infections, as far as we know, we have not lost
any data to viruses over the past 2 years.  This is primarily due to
the relatively long latency (time between infection and destruction)
shown by the viruses we have seen.  As far as I can see, the average
latency for a virus is on the order of weeks, or months.  Of course
this is not always the case, but walking across the street is a crap
shoot too.  Just ask any armadillo.

We are taking further steps in the future, but I will save that for a
future edition of Virus-L.

BTW, if John Perry is reading, he may be interested to know that his
infection was pre-dated by a major infestation of the Ohio Virus at a
university within 50 miles of his location.  They were very lax about
correcting the situation and I would not be surprised if his situation
were an unfortunate consequence.

I hope this helps.

Subject: Possible virus on Commodore

Hi.  I'm posting this for a friend, Steve.  He has a Commodore +4
that he uses for his business but he's been having problems with
what appears to be a virus.

Steve's problem started with a simple error message when he used one
of the utilities.  He know tells me that part of the machine language
code has been erased.  One of the other utilities is now giving him
errors also.

I have a Commodore 64 that I use a lot and I would like to avoid my
friend's problems.  Is there an anti-viral program that I could get to
get rid of it?  Where would I find such software?  How much does
commercial anti-viral software cost?

Any information would be most helpful.

Thanx in advance,
Karyn Palmer

Thanks for your comments on my stealth detector program. I re-wrote it
to check for Interrupt 21 modifications before trying to test for
stealth viruses in memory. Most TSRs do not redirect Int 21 (Disk
Caches and Side Kick are the only two I can name off hand) but these
programs will fool my detection technique. Program follows....

  ADD     [BX+SI],AL
  ADD     [BX+SI],AL
  ADD     [BX+SI],AL

No, this isn't a virus, or even a trojan.  That little DDATE.COM file was
written originally back in 1985-87, turbo pascal 3.0 source if I recall
correctly.  Anyway, the program has a built in capability to display a
message on the beginning or 1st of every month.

The original program, used to have the authors name and phone number.
But, of course, it's easily edited using any binary file editor...

(I've even edited one myself that used to remind me to pay my rent...  :)

Also, note that the DDATE.COM program remembers the date of your last
use of your PC.  It does this by "re-writing" itself on top of itself
each time you run it and hit return.  Thus the date and time of the
program will change each time you run it...  This is normal, and shouldn't
be mistaken for a bogus.

HOWEVER!  Now that all this has been said, watch out for ANY program named
DDATE.COM or DDATE.EXE that is larger than 512 bytes, OK?  (also, you
can do away with DDATE as soon as you buy a clock/calendar board, or
upgrade to a 286/386 with a clock...)

Happy Hunting!  Best of skill!  :)

Subject: Diagnosing a computer virus (IBM MVS)

Colleagues,

I have recently come across a potential problem and would like to take
some preventative measures.  I suspect that my IBM machine, running
MVS, has a virus in it although I have seen no symptoms.  My question
to all of you is how to diagnose the presence of a virus (as opposed
to preventing one).  Are there specialized consultants who do this?
Is there a package which I can use to test my operating system,
subroutines, added-on software, etc. that is available on the market.
Of course I am looking for a simple, no/low cost solution, but I
rather doubt that will exist.  As such, I encourage any input you may
have.

Thank you in advance for your prompt and knowledgeable response.

This does not sound like the CASCADE virus (letters fall vertically to the
bottom of the screen). Also, CASCADE is a descriptive name applied to that
virus, not one that is found in the code (incidently QAPLUS reports that
IRQ 2 on my 386 is assigned to CASCADE also and I am reasonably sure that
it is not infected). Other than the graphics, the symptoms sound like a
variant of the Jerusalem & would recommend running the latest version of
SCAN (v67C) to check. BTW, I was not aware that Norton's SYSINFO (SI) would
return interrupt identification - is this something new in 5.0 ? (I have 4.5)

>>I had an infinite number of directories.

I have seen this happen twice on older machines and have yet to find a good
explination other than once repaired the problem did not reoccur & did not
seem to be a virus. What happens is that a subdirectory is created that
points at the root directory storage area creating an endless loop. Since
they point at the same area, no disk space is actually used. The downside is
that deleting anything in the sub affects the root. All that is necessary
is to use Norton or something to remove the errant subdirectory (but NOT its
files).

***********

	Lately, I have been receiving a number of requests for live viruses
from readers. All have been & will continue to be refused since there is no
way to verify credentials on the net and I will not send any infectious code
over a public network anyway. Period.

	Similarly, information disseminated openly MUST be, to a degree,
censored. Most of the researchers I know share the view that we are not
going to point out a virus writer's mistakes to them for correction in the
next version.

	I will say that EVERY memory resident virus seen so far is
easily detectable if you understand the basics of DOS (and this includes
the "stealthy" 4096, Joshi, and Whale ALL of which are detectable in memory
by the same 1331 byte .COM file {mostly ASCII text messages} I wrote three
years ago in response to a BRAIN outbreak) and, if the virus is not memory
resident, is even easier to find.

I've seen similar symptoms when running old, non-copyrighted game software
on 13" screens.  I never paid much attention to it, and assumed that
either the original author didn't conform to the standard interface, or
that the standard was established some time later.  I have seen it with
several programs, though never with a "Kitty-cat" face.  Also, if the
graphic is changing, all of them change the same, and they are spaced at
regular intervals across the menu bar.  Never saw one reboot, but I had to
do it anyway.

Subject: Plastique/Anti-CAD viruses (PC)

There are now four known viruses in this series; all are based heavily
on the JV, with the addition of a timer-interrupt handler that plays
music periodically, some routines to make the occasional disk-write
fail, and (in the later ones) code to infect boot records as well as
executables; the later two (I think) also infect on OPENs of files
called EXE or COM, as well as on executions.  Most or all of them also
react in various ways to attempts to execute any program called
ACAD.EXE (is that familiar to everyone?).  Each one contains a string
(stored garbled in all but the first, earliest virus).  I give the
strings in clear (and slightly reformatted) below.  Does anyone know
where Fen Chia U. is?  (I've also removed the vowel from the leading
obscenity in the first message...)

Subject: Request re book references

Hello,

I am currently writing a book on computer viruses. Many of you will
say: Another one? What can this offer that others haven't already?
Well, the answer is: I am trying to write it from the student's point
of view. It is going to be a tutorial, though technical book for
students on how to prevent viruses from spreading around. Since
students are today the main source of virus spreading, I would like to
get them to be the source of virus exterminating too, but that can
only be through educating them...

To write my book, I would like to have some references, so I'd like to
ask anyone to send me information on the very recently released books
(one is by Mc Afee Associates) such as Author, Title, ISBN and price
if possible. The reason is, I am trying to present the college with a
budget and will need this information soon...

Thanks in advance,
