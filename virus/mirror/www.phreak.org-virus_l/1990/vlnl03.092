VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Sorry for the omission.  Yes, I did need to set up addressability based
on 4K blocks, and set up my registers appropriately (it's been a while
since I've done bare-metal programming).

That's news to me.  I didn't think vendors would particularly want you to be
able to pick apart their code.  Hmmmm...I can imagine some protesting here.

Very true, once you get around the protection mechanisms, the ability to
wreak havoc will be there.  As long as these protection mechanisms exist,
there will always be ways around them--fact of life (sigh :-( ).
As far as IEHONESTY, I'll just have to concede I'm new in the field (only
been at it for a year), and I'm still a bit damp behind the ears.

Yes, these problems do exist on a PC.  My intuition is that because a
mainframe environment is more complex, then more complex are the applications
written for them, therefore the more problems a virus is going to have
successfully infecting.

True, it is always a complex task, and sometimes involves exploiting bugs/
features of the system...certainly these are more prevalent in a mainframe
OS.  That strict programming standards make it easier for viruses isn't
necessarily true.  A homogenous environment makes it easier for them to
spread once they've got a foothold, but it is hardware, OS, and security
subsystem protection mechanisms that make it more difficult to infect a
mainframe.  Not to say it's impossible to infect a mainframe, we've already
seen that there are ways to do it, just that it's more difficult.  As Kelly
said above, there are many people around who have the knowledge to do so,
and there probably always will be (as long as there are system programmers,
anyway).  But these people are, as a rule, your trusted staff (thankfully).

>Why not also extend the file a little longer to accomodate those larger
>viruses?

This is another way, but because of the nature of files on MVS, may
get a little sticky.  The pds library maintains directory pointers
to where the individual members are within the dataset, these would
have to be modified (correctly, otherwise you would trash the library,
it would be unusable, and the virus causes its own extinction).  In
addition, there is a VTOC (roughly equivalent to a FAT) for each
disk pack on the system that keeps track of where the dataset resides.
If adding code causes the dataset to go into another extent, this may
have to be dealt with.

My mistake, I didn't mean to imply that there is such a security system,
to my knowledge it doesn't exist (by all rights, there should be something
in the works at least, it could be devastating to get caught offguard by
a mainframe virus considering the amount of data one could stand to lose
by formatting a 3380!)  What I meant was that the security system is
can track write (or allocate, or whatever) access to files that aren't yours,
and it falls on the security people to audit these and report anything
suspicious to the systems people (unfortunately this isn't a real great
solution--how do you define suspicious??).  The system managers *SHOULD*
spend time installing and checking security features...I feel it's part
of their job.  How do you maintain the integrity of a system that doesn't
have any security?  Notwithstanding trust, what about innocent accidents?

Subject: device drivers/viruses/antiviruses (PC)

 -----First Observation-----

   One of the commonalities of TSR virus-checking utilities seems to be
 insertion as the first line of the AUTOEXEC.BAT, which of course means they
 cannot prevent any attacks which occur from power-up through the CONFIG.SYS
 load, and in fact are not active if the AUTOEXEC.bat does not load (for
 whatever reason).

 -----Second Observation-----

   Given the proliferation of device drivers, from so-called-enhanced
 replacements of MOUSE.SYS and ANSI.SYS, to the zillions of display and printer
 drivers, some of which (essentially filters, granted) are designed for
 placement into the CONFIG.SYS file. Whereas most everyone would agree that
 COM, EXE, and BAT files are 'executable', somehow the notion of PIF and SYS
 files as such seems less widespread.

 -----Third Observation-----

   I use (and like) the CONFIG.CTL routine from PC Magazine (c) 1988 by Ziff
 Communications. It allows me the option to alter the composition of the
 CONFIG.SYS for the current session _BEFORE_ it loads.

 -----Hash Total of Observations-----

   If CONFIG.CTL can hook the system prior to CONFIG.SYS installation, then so
 can virus infections (including a tainted CONFIG.CTL), and it's much easier to
 relocate and manipulate 200 bytes of CONFIG.SYS than an entire boot sector
 (like BRAIN does) to disguise it's operation.

   This would appear to be a nice way to load the anti-viral filters and such
 also: it would at least put them into the system earlier (it seems) than
 invoking them in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and stop a suspicious driver from
 loading, rather than detecting it after-the-fact. Are there any anti-viral PC
 products which load/activate via the CONFIG.SYS?

   There are also empty EPROM sockets in my PC: would it be possible to produce
 code for a viral filter on EPROM (which would activate prior to CONFIG.SYS)?

   I would rather buy a chip which has been extensively tested to filter my
 system, and activates earlier on in the boot cycle, than depend on code out
 there where it is exposed to the viruses ... and EPROMS can't be altered
 without several deliberate preliminary steps outside the control of the PC.

   Could validation software be produced which checks ROM and/or custom EPROM
 anti-viral code, or could the EPROMS be self-validating?

   Comments appreciated.

Sorry.  Suppose that "troublesome" turns out to be an understatement?
One crime of omission does not justify another of commission.  Being
opposed to ignorance is no excuse for setting in motion an overtly
destructive, but otherwise unpredictable, process which once started
is immediatlely outside your control.  I think what you have is a
rationale for what you intend to do anyway, rather than a valid
justification.

Subject: The Army, Glass Houses, and $$$

I hope that the story about the Army spending a half a million dollars
of our money to commission something that they  can  hardly avoid anyway
turns out to be apochryphal.

However, just in case they are serious, I am a small business man, and I
will give them the answers pro bono.

First, people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.  The US
Army will be far more vulnerable to any virus that they create than will
be any potential enemy.  A virus depends for its success on the size of
the target population and the amount of sharing among members of the
population.  Thus, the US Army will be more vulnerable than any
potential, computer starved, enemy.

Least the Army think that it can rely upon prior vaccination against its
own virus, they need to look at the size of the population that they
would have to deal with.  They are adding to that population at a rate
that would exceed the most optimistic assessment of the rate at which
they can hope to vaccinate.

Second, like biological agents, computer viruses are neither tactical
nor strategic weapons, they are doomsday weapons.  Unlike Trojan Horse
attacks, viruses cannot be aimed or controlled.

Third, if they want one, all they have to do is go the nearest computer
lab or retail store.  They will be lucky if they can avoid one.  Failing
that, most high school kids would be happy to write one for nothing.  It
certainly does not cost $500000 to get someone to write one.  Look at
all the ones that have been written for no motive stronger than
amusement.

Rather than commissioning new ones, they better spend the money stopping
the spread of those that they  already have and haven't noticed yet.

Dear God, the story is just stupid enough to be true.  Bureaucracy is
just as mindless and uncontrollable as viruses.

Although I am not a virus watcher in the real sense, I did get a set
of programs from Fridrik Skulason in Iceland called F-PROT that has a
blurb that lists a number of virii and what they do.  This particular
one was listed, at least most of the message seemds the same.

He calls it the "Disk Killer" and claims that it encrypts all data by
using a simple XOR method.

Fridrik can be contacted through the net.

I dunno... I've heard that the Soviets computer technology lags behind

most of them are some computer columnist who happened to be available

be extremely dangerous -- something along the lines of killing flies

Subject: Viruses as military weapons

I'm curious as to how one would actually implant a virus over military
radio frequencies, especially if one were using a closed system.  The only
thing I could think of would be to intercept a program being downloaded to
a sub-station, or under an espionage style sabotage  (I.E. Having an
actual person sneak onto a base, and implant the virus onto the computer.)
I don't think they could be used as a battlefield weapon (Quick Lieutenant,
fire that Brain virus, that's the only thing that'll stop 'em now!)
Course there's also the example from Star Trek II:The Wrath of Kahn, where
Kirk and gang use the computer codes to turn off the shields on Kahn's ship,
when he thought he was getting the data of the Genesis program.  But that
depended on an open system.
I guess I just want to know how somebody would get a virus onto a program that
never asked for access on the outside world.  (Superimposing magnetic images

          More about Sharp's X68000 Viri in Japan

     Artdink Inc. is now distributing the vaccine against the virus
which was contained in the simulation game software "FAR SIDE MOON".
It says that the virus in question is attached to the battery
backed-up area of the SRAM of X68000 and if the system is booted by a
floppy without the protect seal, the floppy is contaminated.  It is
named "NX68K IPL V1.02".  The effect of the virus is it will destroy
the data on the floppy after July this year.  This virus started to
prevail among X68000 users last December.

     Artdink started to sell "FAR SIDE MOON" for X68000 on April 13
(Friday !!!!).  3200 sets have been sold before calling back due to
the virus.  Not all the articles are contaminated, only those in
limited lots.  This software consists of three floppies, among which
only game disk is contaminated while system and data disks are not.
If a user boots the dirty floppy according to the manual, the virus is
not transfered to the SRAM.

    The vaccine, named "DOCTOR" was written by the editorial office of
the journal "Oh! X" for X68000 users.  It initializes the SRAM and
make it immune and it kills the virus on the floppy.  However, it is
effective only to two viri V1.02 and V1.05.

Subject: Alleged GEM/3 with Virus (PC)

On April 20th, 1990 a message reporting that the STONED virus had shown up
in shrink-wrapped copies of GEM/3 Desktop was posted.  I have seen the
original message in comp.virus and VIRUS-L but have seen no followup.  Does
anyone have any news or updates on this?
