VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

This could not be due to the virus action. I myself experienced that,
if the virus infected an .EXE file, sometimes CLEAN software fails to
recover the file. I am not sure of this, but since Jerusalem often
produces multiple copies of itself in a single .EXE file (a bug, I
guess), the malfunction of CLEAN software could be due to this. These
are my guesses, based on my limited personal experience. Anyway, in
the CLEAN documentation, users are made aware of the possibility of
bad recover of .EXE files.  Somewhere out SIMTEL there is a software
called VKILL, which works very well against Jerusalem virus.

	Have now had a chance to do a bitwise compare of the boot
record submitted by Mr. Stoltz and it matches that of a disk formatted
using Peter Norton's Advanced Utilities 4.5 Safe Format (dump below).
This is often found in mass-duplicated disks. Since it is an exact
match, I do not believe that the problem is here, however the disk may
still contain malicious software elsewhere.

	Just as a technical note, after retrieval of the original
ALERT, it was massaged by WordStar 5.0 and passed through DOS DEBUG to
create a binary file to create the listing below. This permitted a DOS
COMP (compare) of the record with a dump of a disk formmatted using
Safe Format. Incidently, the PNCI stands for Peter Norton Computing
Inc.

Subject: Slightly clearer translation

   There may be no need for yet another translation of the German
text, but I offer this as possibly the easiest for Americans to
understand.  It was written by a group of computer-literate graduate
students here at the National Institutes of Health and then edited by
myself.

Help against camouflage virus:

   The infamous 4096 virus, alias Frodo, which loads itself into main
memory and makes itself invisible to most currently-used utilities
(see the German publication: Computerwoche of 8/10/90, p. 10), has an
Achilles' heel: precisly its own invisibility.  Copying an infected
program may, if done correctly, lead to a virus-free program.  To
accomplish this, the virus must be resident in main memory.  Choose a
name for the destination file that does not have an executable file
suffix; that is, avoid COM, .EXE, .OVL, and .SYS extensions.  When the
copy is made the virus will actually delete its own virus code from
the copied file in its usual attempt to hide itself.  The destination
file will therefore consist of the original program file before
infection.  The best way to make the copy is by using a compression
program like PKARC.  It is still unclear if the same method will work
with DOS's COPY or XCOPY programs.  Once the copy is made, the
infected programs have to be deleted, the system must be rebooted from
a guaranteed 'clean' disk, and the copied files need to be
decompressed (or renamed) back to their original file names.

Virus experts caution against the approach outlined above: this method
is more tricky than it appears.  It is recommended only to those
experienced computer users who understand their machines at the
machine code level.  The preferred method is to use a
professionally-written antivirus program designed to handle this
virus, like those of Solomon (Findviru), McAfee (Scan), or Skulason
(F-Fehler).  EPG Internationals Turbo Anti Virus is also supposed to
be able to remove this virus.

Two additional tips:
1. Signature programs and virus scanners should only be started
   from a guaranteed clean disk, and only after the PC has been
   booted from a clean disk.
2. When the virus becomes active it does not print the message
   'Frodo lives' owing to a programming error in the virus.
   Instead, the computer will just crash.

Subject: Alleged Postscript Virus

In response to Fred Bals message about the "Postscript virus" there
has not been (to the best of my knowledge) any documented instance of
this Postscript virus.  There are several utilities in the public
domain that alleged they defend against it though.

Apparently the article refers to the PostScript "server" password, the
password requires to make a permanent status change to the printer.  I
believe the password is a 2-byte unsigned integer.  In order to change
this password, a PostScript job must know the original server
password.  The default password is 0, but it can be changed with the
"setpassword" command.  (Not too sure about the actual command
word...my PostScript is rusty...)

A program that resets the server password would be really nasty, as it
would prevent any future permanent status changes to the printer (such
as defaultpapertray, defaultpapersize, etc.)  However, a careful
system administrator would set the password to something other than 0;
this action would keep such a program from doing any harm.  As far as
I know, there is no way to figure out the server password (unless, of
course, you know it).

A program like this would do it:

serverdict begin
xxxxx exitserver
% xxxxx is the old "server" password.
statusdict begin
yyyyy setpassword
% yyyyy is the new password.
% (I hope this is the right syntax!!)
(ctl-d)

Someone might want to get a PostScript "red" book to check me on this....

from the students!!!  If you have ANY diskettes that have been used on
the PC's on campus, PLEASE bring them into one of the PC Labs on the
second floor of the Business building.  The lab monitors will check
and clean your diskettes for any of the three viruses mentioned
above!!

People at the school rely on the computers to do their school work!
Not having your diskettes checked means that you may reinfect a PC and
cause someone else unneeded grief!!!  Please comply!!  You can even
check and clean your own diskettes and systems with the McAfee
software on this BBS!!!  Business building lab monitors thank you for

It infects all programs invoked via the pertinent system function

Subject: Help with Jerusalem B (PC)

I am a regular 'listener' to Virus-L, but this is the first time I am
faced with removing a virus from someone's computer.  I tried to
remove Jerusalem B from a computer using McAfee's M-J.  It claimed to
have removed many occurances the first time I ran it, but Scan (v6.3)
still found lots of infected files.  Subsequent runs of M-J said
"clean" for all the files, yet Scan (and VIRscan) said files were
still infected.  I have tried using a 'clean' disk for boot and virus
scanning.  Note, M-J complained about my write protect being on.
  What I am doing wrong?  Note, due to problems with BITFTP,
I would rather using a modem long distance to transfer files
then pull them off of Bitnet/Internet -- so please make
suggestions accordingly.  Thanks.

I've found that the educational market (i.e. schools, universities,
etc.)  are the worst for spreading ANYTHING. This is partially a
function of the ease with which Macintosh files can be copied, and the
desire for poor students to copy anything of interest.  It does not
seem to happen as much at IBM PC sites, since files are harder to
copy. For instance, WordPerfect on the macintosh only really requires
1 diskette (2 if you want spell checking), or even just the
application file; on the PC, you need MANY diskettes to copy the files
& it's not so easy to determine which ones are needed.  The last place
that I had to install WP 5.0 only had 5.25" drives, and there was a
pile of 15 source diskettes!

Subject: Scan v67 and killer.com (PC)

	There seems to be a little problem with the latest version of
	Scan and its related products.  Killer is (I think) locally written,
	and is designed to remove the STONED virus.

	When I ran Scan v67 it picked up killer.com as being infected with
	the invader virus.  Thinking that I actually might have the virus
	I used clean to fix it up.  This unfortunatly seems to have
	destroyed killer.com.  Checking further, I discovered the invader
	virus on the version of killer.com given to me by my dealer.

	Having successfuly used killer.com before, and the 'virus' not
	having spread, I was a little surprised, and used scan v67 to
	check out killer.com that was on a pc at VUW.  That too it appears
	had this virus.

	The documentation for Scan v67 said that the invader virus is a new
	virus, and that was why the release of this version of Scan was
	delayed.  Putting 2 and 2 together, I assume that this means that
	killer.com has some code in it that Scan uses to identify the
	invader virus.

	If anyone who could either confirm or refute this, I would
	appreatiate it.

Subject: VIRUS-L indices and misc administrivia

Thanks to all of you who responded to my request for input on whether
or not to distribute the VIRUS-L indices periodically!  The
overwhelming (i.e., unanimous) result is that we should do it.  There
were also a couple of good suggestions.  Depending on file size, etc.,
I currently plan to distribute the indices every 100 digests, in a
separate digest(s) - on a trial basis.  If, after sending them out, it
is decided that this is too much bandwidth (or some such), then I'll
not send more out.

Also, sorry for the delay in some of the messages in today's digest.
I was out of town all of last week, and terminal access was at a
premium.  We did have one message sent in to VALERT-L during that
time, and it went out asap.  A reminder to anyone sending to VALERT-L
- if you want your message to go out as quickly as possible, phone the
CERT hotline (412-268-6935) and instruct whoever answers the phone to
contact me.

Thanks,

Ken
