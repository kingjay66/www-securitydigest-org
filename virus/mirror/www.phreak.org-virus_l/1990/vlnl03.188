VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Pipelines in DOS (Was Is this a virus? Help!) (PC)

Robert E. Mee sees strange files when he pipes a MS-DOS directory
listing through more.

> dir | more

There are essentially two ways to implement pipelines.  UNIX creates
two concurrent processes. The kernel (at least I think it is the
kernel) keeps the two processes synchronized. One process pours stuff
into the pipe until it fills up, and then goes to sleep while the
other empties the pipe. The other then sleeps while the first refills
the pipe.

MS-DOS doesn't support concurrent processes. There are no kernel
facilities for managing interprocess communications. Pipes are
implemented directly by command.com.

The mechanism is something like this.
    1.  Command.com creates a temporary file and attaches it's standard
	output to it.
    2.  The first program then runs. It inherits it's standard files
        (including it's standard output) from command.com. So it's output
	gets dumped into the temporary file.
    3.  When the first process (dir in your case) exits, command.com attaches
        it's standard input to the temporary file, and starts the
	second process (more). When this process finishes, command.com
	deletes the temporary file.

Thus at the time dir runs, the temporary file has been created, but
still has nothing in it. So you see a zero sized file with some weird
system generated name.

The second file is related to it in some weird unspecified way. My
guess is that it contains data that command.com must keep around to
implement all the redirection. It probably saves this in a file rather
than memory. There are a number of good reasons why this is a sensible
way to do it in DOS. The basic one being that memory is unprotected in
this environment, and a child process can do terrible things to memory
owned by it's parent.

The bottom line on your trojan is that you were seeing the files that
DOS created to implement your pipeline.

	Because you didn't mention which computer you use I guess it's a Mac.

	You can copy the program Disinfectant 2.3 from anonymous ftp.
	It contains a rather comprehensive list of all known viruses.

Subject: Virus info databases

Does anybody know if there are any (publicly reachable) databases with
virus information ?  I mean real databases, that use search commands
and keys, not a repository for various texts on the subject.  I am not
interested in commercial packages that can be bought for a pc.

The reason is that I am going to build a database for my own computer,
in swedish language, and would like to know how much work has been
done world-wide on this.  Also if there are any such projects in
preparation or progress.  Yes, I would like to copy the database if
so.  There is also possibility to create an english-language database
if there is enough interest.  At the moment I feel there is too much
information coming thru virus-l, with too little search structure.
Which means it is hard for a new-comer to use the list efficiently.  A
database could help a little.

(There is a remote possibility of setting up a database and file
 repository (like wsmr-simtel20) on a networked computer here in
 Sweden).

Any replies sent directly to me will be summarized to the list.

Thanks!      jan-lien@vera.stacken.kth.se

I was running a routine scan on some of our diskettes and got the
following message using scan 2.3V56 Found Yale/Alameda Virus [Alameda]
in boot sector.

We run a PC lab with all floppies and this was found on two of our DOS
diskettes. Can anyone tell me exactly what this virus does, how to
clean it and how to prevent reinfection..

Also we have seen what we think may be a virus that shows up as inital
bad sectors, but when we run Norton Disk Doctor it keeps getting more
and more bad sectors.. Any information or suggestion would be greatly
appreciated..
 Any replies can be email directtly and I'll post a summary..
thank you..

Subject: Antiviral reviews

There have been, fairly consistently, those who have requested not
only the names, but reviews of the various anti-viral packages.  I am
writing to as many companies as I can find (and there are many), to
request a copy of any anti-viral software (and some hardware) package.
As manager of the data security information network on the SUZY
information system, I provide reviews of anti-viral software to the
members.  I am also in final preparation for a series of seminars
which will be presented in a number of centres around North America,
and will be providing demonstrations of various software packages at
that time.  Formal reviews have also been contracted by ISR Software
Review Corporation, and will be published by their service.

As I said, I am writing to all the companies I have leads for.
However, I do not wish to leave out any "minor players" or
"newcomers", and therefore would be pleased to review any packages
sent to me.  Reviews and demonstrations will only be conducted on full
packages received with documentation.  Unless otherwise specified by
the publisher, no copies of any software received will be made
available to any third party, either by loan, gift or sale.  All
packages received will be retained by Robert Slade, and will be used
for demonstration in the seminars unless the publisher requests
otherwise.

Subject: Removal of EDV? (PC)

Can anyone help in getting rid of the EDV virus?

A colleague has this virus on his IBM PC. He has run the scan program
and detected it's presence. He has rebooted from a 'clean' floppy and
run the 'clean' program. On checking the hard disk with the scan
program it runs 'clean.' Yet when he reboots from the hard disk EDV is
back.  Does he really have to re-install DOS?

Any help would be appreciated. Regards, Daud.

Subject: a Macintosh WORM???!!! (Mac)

We have a student who claims that Vaccine is reporting a "DCD WORM"
infestation

I have never heard of a WORM on the Mac as yet, but who knows!

I have not seen this message and nothing I have can detect it on
floppies that contain the "infected" files!  Supposedly SAM is one of
the infected files as well as GateKeeper (and Aid)!

I'm lost here, any help would be GREAT!!!!

Sorry!  I've heard many horror stories, some in this group, about
viruses in shrink-wrapped software.  I've downloaded from dial-in
bbs's and done anonymous ftp, and yes, copied software from friends.
I've never been infected.

The only place where I've seen infections are in multiple use
environments like computer labs at Universities.  Although I haven't
seen infections from any other sources, they do exist, and I check
everything just in case.  Viruses are spread in many ways.

If you are referring to Anti-viral programs, I'm sure that they are
the most virus free programs you can find, other than something you
write yourself!  (My experience is mostly with Disinfectant,
Gatekeeper, SCAN, and F-PROT).

Subject: Re: Virus "WDEF A", help! (Mac)

From the documentation that comes with Disinfectant 2.3, it seems that
WDEF comes in two strains, the A and B strain; the latter beeps when
it infects a new disk, the former doesn't.

It attacks only the Desktop file; as a consequence, you should
be able to eliminate the infection by booting from a LOCKED floppy
and holding down shift-option-cloverleaf as you boot, until you
get the "Are you sure you want to rebuild the desktop on "DiskName"?
This may take a few minutes". Just do it. Apparently, rebuilding the
desktop eliminates current infection of that file. Remember, though,
that EVERY SINGLE FLOPPY that talked to your infected computer will
also have an infected Desktop file and will need to have it either
rebuilt, or scanned and disinfected using Disinfectant or the like.

I have waged a fairly continuous war against this little booger for
the last two months in our department, as there are sufficient numbers
of idiots who continue to use the same old infected disks to re-infect
cleaned ones....grrrrr....this particular virus is bad news especially
for the portable and IIci; perhaps also for the newer models as well.
Hope this helps.

Subject: Dark Avenger frequency?

I was just talking to a reporter for a U.S. paper (calling from
Bulgaria!); he says that he's been told by at least two people that
the Dark Avenger (and/or other "Bulgarian" viruses) is very common in
certain parts of Europe.  One person, he says, tells him that he's
seeing several Dark Avenger reports per week.  Does this agree with
anyone else's observations?  We get rather few reports of the Dark
Avenger (or the VACSINA, or any other TPxxVIRs, or really any other
"Bulgarian" viruses); are there places (many places?) in the world
where these viruses are very common?
