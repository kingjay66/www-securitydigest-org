VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

	Since the USA is the most lawyer-heavy country in the world,
for some time I have been expecting a civil suit to result from someone
who should have known better shipping a virus. Once this happens, there
will probably be a mad scramble by software houses to CYA, a new breed
of malpractise insurance will be created, a new clause will appear in
govenment boilerplate, & software screening of distributions will become
standard. All adding cost.

	Next, statutes will be enacted requiring labeling of re-shrink-
wrapped software, software prices will increase dramatically, & the
industry will experience another recession.

	Of course, by then the Lotus "look and feel" suit may have
made it impossible to sell new software (in 1966 by Government decree
the "look & feel" of automobile and motorcycle controls were
standardized as a safety measure. Then it was considered desirable for
everyone to be the same - Harley-Davidson had to move the gear shift
from the left to the right foot to match the Japanese - now, doing
this for software may be illegal).

	These are the good old days.

Admitted. Self-modifying and self-encrypting viruses are hard to take care of
when a general method is wanted. Still- I believe there is general agreement
about the need for algorithmic, virus-specific methods when dealing with these
viruses. About non-static code portions -- it must be possible to exclude them
from the calculation range, so that they dont make the checksumming fail...

 > Still, those problems can be easily solved.

I agree. No big deal....

But there are other problems:

* Which algorithm ?
I am not a mathematician and I'm not experienced with checksumming algorithms.
It would have to be insured that the algorithm provides "reasonable safety"
(whatever that is). Some mathematics-guru would have to help here....

* Security
One of the problems of my method is that a user can not verify whether a
signature is 'legitimate'. If somebody spreads false signatures, people would
lose trust in the system and ....

* Qualification of people creating signatures
People can create signatures and checksumming/range information that is unsafe.
Such data will destroy legitimate applications. There would have to be
guidelines to ensure that people don't cause damage inadvertetly.
Checksumming/Range data should be compatible -- i.e., if two people at two
different locations describe the same virus, there should be a way to find out
that both describe the same virus. This would also solve the 'naming problem'
:-)

Please let me know what you think about all this.

Kind regards,

Subject: PC Today Magazine Virus (PC)

Just in case some people were wondering why their copy of PC Today did
not contain a diskette with a (dead) virus on it...

There are two magazines named PC Today.  One is published in the UK,
and one is published in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.  I just spoke with
Steve Mann, the editor of the Nebraska publication, and he assured me
that the two are independant of each other, and that his magazine has
never distributed any diskettes.

McAfee's Virlist indicates that the 4096 does not *infect* the boot
sector, and that is correct.  It also indicates that it does not cor-
rupt or overwrite the boot sector.  As far as I know, that too is cor-
rect.  True, the 4096 contains a routine which *tries* to modify the
boot sector in order to display the FRODO LIVES message on subsequent
boots, but I haven't heard of a version which actually *succeeds* in
doing this.  If you have a version which really does this, please let
us know.

  Just a couple of minor comments on Padgett Peterson's posting.  He
writes:

There is at least one PC virus which uses only 1K of high RAM: the
Merritt/Alameda/Yale virus.

Maybe we mean different things by "algorithm", but as far as I'm con-
cerned, the algorithm can be known as long as the checksums depend on
an unknown user-dependent key.

PC Today magazine has been receiving calls regarding a recent virus alert.
This virus alert apparently originated in Europe.  PC Today is published
by Peed Corporation in Lincoln, Nebraska and is not distributed in Europe
(a few copies are mailed to individual subscribers in Europe).  Peed
Corporations's PC Today has never distributed any diskette with its
magazine.  Our magazine is not the subject of this alert.

Repeat:  The US publication, PC Today, is not involved in this alert and
does not distribute diskettes with its publication.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: LaserWriter virus?

[Ed. After much pleading, Woody convinced me to post this message for
him, which contains binary PostScript code (apparently he was
receiving many many e-requests for the code).  I am personally opposed
to distributing binary code on a public discussion group such as this
one for a variety of reasons.  To its credit, this code was posted to
two other newsgroups, and apparently met with lots of approval there.
Note that anyone choosing to use the code (on a postscript printer)
must do so at their own risk.  Furthermore, I do not wish to set a
precedent here by sending out the binary - this is both a first and a
last time.  In the future any and all binaries will be distributed via
the VIRUS-L/comp.virus archive sites, including CERT/CC's anonymous
FTP facility, cert.sei.cmu.edu.]

WHEW!  After 20 or 30 requests for this code, I guess that I'd better
clarify a thing or 2

My address is
Woody Baker

Manor, Tx. 78653

Please understand that the reset routine allows you to alter ANY part of
the eeprom, including machine hardware registration parameters, printer
serialnumbers (will handily defeat the old Adobe fonts that were tied
to a particular serial number) if you know the serial number, among
many other things.  For this reason, I had determined that there might be
some liabilty associated with the distribution of this code.  Thus the
rules:

Department, or company letterhead, signed by a department head.
The basic reason, is so I have some thing to point to if someone says
"I got it from woody...(after messing up a network printer...)

My offer still holds, but here is the more benign version.  Both routines
are specific to 68000 based ADOBE postscript interpreters.  Both routines
depend on a short machine language routine that gets downloaded into the
printer, and establishes a new operator.  The following code
handles this by simply reporting the password.  I post it here, as
grabbed off comp.lang.postscript.  This should suffice for nearly all
needs.  I'd prefer people used this one, rather than the one that I have
simply due to the reduced potential for mis-use....

Here is the piece of code that resets the password in a PostScript printer,
which I've obtained.
I'd like to make a point of clarification. Some people might know that Woody
Baker offered to make copies of his code available to people who wrote in to
him, subject to slightly more onerous conditions than at least one other person
on the net thought correct. I then offered to make this code available,
making an oblique barbed reference to Woody in the process. I have since had
the opportunity to speak to Woody about this, and I would like to emphasize tha
t
Woody's code is more complex and contains more powerful, and dangerous
operators than mine, and considerable potential for harm. Woody's terms
are entirely appropriate and generous considering what he had on offer. I
think I've provided a cleaner and simpler solution but those who need the
additional power of Woody's code can still write to Woody.
This program resets the password to zero, using the standard PostScript
operator setpassword. Woody and I both feel that in this form, the code is
useful to those who have forgotten the laserwriter password and don't feel
apple ought to charge and arm and a leg to correct the problem, and not
particularly dangerous, though of course such things by their nature
can cause harm. Please use with care. I can't guarantee this will work but
it's not likely to blow your laserwriter to bits in the process, at least. It
will most likely fail on clones and won't work with Emerald RIPs.
