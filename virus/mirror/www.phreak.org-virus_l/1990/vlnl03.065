VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Virex will correctly repair multiply infected applications, and so will
Disinfectant, I believe.  Virex will tell you about the "newest" infection,
repair it, then recheck the file and discover the older infection -- and
let you repair that too.

Subject: How to protect a Mac hard disk from infection (Mac)

We are about to receive several Mac machines with hard disks sometime
soon and would like to find out what other people are doing to protect
their mac systems.  Can you tell us what anti virual software you use,
by what company and it's cost!  Do you know of any good shareware
products?  Is there a way to make your Mac hard disk read only?

Subject: SCANV60.ZIP (PC)

The Association of PC User Groups BBS in CA has a message on the opening
screen to the effect that SCANV60.ZIP has been released in a bogus form by
someone, and might contain a virus, and that anyone finding it should send
a copy to the CVIA BBS. Unfortunately, the APCUG BBS sysop has been unable
to find out the file size and date of the alleged bogus version. He is
still making enquiries.

What concerns me is that a version of the above file has reached Australia
allegedly from a "reputable" source in the USA, from which the importer is
also obliged to download a Fidonet conference (details not known). Anyway,
the file size of this SCANV60.ZIP is 44482 bytes and its date is 03-19-90.
I have a copy of this file and have uploaded it to the APCUG BBS for relay
to the CVIA. (Aside: BT Tymnet, an APCUG sponsor, gives member groups two
free accounts to call CA from most parts of the world for one hour daily)

I note from a recent posting about new uploads to SIMTEL20 that the version
thereon has a date of 03-21-90 and a file size of 39508 bytes.

A user of the APCUG BBS (also claiming to have a reputable copy) gave a
listing (probably via SHEZ) where the total column indicates a file size of
43872 bytes (date unknown).

Since the above warning has been on the APCUG BBS for about two weeks, but
nothing like that has been reported here, I am asking you all if you know
something about this one.

Does McAfee release more than one version of a given file without changing
its version number?

From:    "Craig A. Summerhill" <SUMMERHI@WSUVM1.BITNET>
Subject: 128K, What's it mean? (PC)

Could some reader of the VIRUS-L list please assist me?

I believe that one of our machines (PC/XT running DOS) may have
contracted a virus.  Here's the scoop as I see it:

     * within a directory on the machine which contains utility
       programs (all have .EXE or .COM extensions excluding a
       few .DOC files which accompany the programs) each utility
       is exactly 128 bytes larger than the same files on another
       machine in the office.
     * the secretary using the machine says she has been experiencing
       frequent systems crashes within the last two weeks.
     * One of the utilities is a disk parking utility.  When I tried
       to run it the program ended in a loop.  I restored the file
       from an apparently uninfected machine, and it ran fine.
       However, after running one of the other utilities in the
       directory the file had been altered by 128 bytes again.

It seems like a pretty clear-cut case of a virus, but my problem is
I don't know *which one*.  Can any of you that are more experienced
suggest which virus may effect .EXE and .COM programs and increase
the file size 128 bytes?  It seems innert, but I don't know...

Also, what anti-viral software (if any) will erradicate it?  (And
need I say salvage any data files)

Please reply directly to me as this is of immediate interest to me,
and I am often unable to read VIRUS-L in a timely manner.

Subject: Information please... (Apple ][)

Hello all!  I need some information on Apple II viruses.  I am writing a
paper/book on viruses and I lost my section of notes that covers the Apple II
stuff!  Any information that you could send me would be great!!  PLEASE
send to me DIRECT (wlhadley@gmuvax.gmu.edu OR wlhadley@gmuvax.bitnet).
I will forward anything that I feel would be of general interest to the list,
but there is no need to clutter the list with detailed info.  Again, ANYTHING
you can send on Apple II viruses will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

Subject: Updated signature files for IBM VIRSCAN?

Have there been any published updates to the two signature files
(SIGBOOT.LST and SIGFILE.LST) for the IBM VIRSCAN program?  Both the
signature files on my copy are dated 19-09-89. Am I behind the times?
