Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: virus checking software for PCs (PC)

I'm looking for a virus checker for an IBM PC that has the following
characteristics:

- -- Not memory resident, and so does not check for infections in real
time

- -- runs any program I call after first checking a checksum or CRC
against a pre-stored library (and warning me if a difference is
found).

- -- user-adjusted formula for checksumming

- -- will calculate
checksums for me.

In other words, I'm willing to accept an infection once, but not to
have it run.

anything out there?
thanks.

Oh dear.
This is bad thing number 1. Not taking backups is the Russian Roulette
of computers. Maybe you won't get hit, and then again...

Aaaaack!
This is *extremely* bad thing number 2. Doing this kind of thing
almost guarantees that sooner or later the Resource Manager is going
to get confused and start loading from the wrong System file... At
that point it's Katie-bar-the-door; no one can predict exactly what
will happen. Except that it probably will be bad.

The only thing that's at fault here is, as you said, "poor installation
practices". WDEF does not carry any payload which should cause these
kind of problems. However, dropping a virus into an already potentially
bad situation is simply asking for trouble.

Recommendations:
1) Take *all* of the System folders off the disk and reinstall from a
   new set of distribution disks. If you don't have them, write me
   privately and I'll help you get a copy. PLEASE use the Installer!
2) Make up a sign and post it near the Mac saying "Did we do the
   backups?". Even better, make up a startup screen that says the
   same thing. I can help on that if you need advice.

We've recently picked up the DARK AVENGER virus on some of our
systems, and I'd like to see if anyone can detail the activity this
one engages in.  It seems to be easily eradicated, and not too
vicious, but I'd appreciate a description of how it works and what
it's intended to do.

I have an idea about that bug, Carlos.  Easiest solution: update to
version 1.81, the newest release of FLU_SHOT+.  V1.4 is at least 18
months out of date.  I determined that a)CMOS was a royal pain in the
butt to check, causing more problems than it was worth and b)wasn't
really all that important to protect.

I have seen this more times than desired but the effect is usually
immediate both on the 386-25 in my den and the Zenith 248/386 at work.
The cause has always been something writing/executing into a BIOS area
in high memory. This normally occurs right after I decide to load
something into an "unused" area, and I find out that it was not unused
when either the system reboots continually or the screen puts on a
spectacular light show.

The latest excursion was caused by a faulty AboveBoard (just got the
RA from Intel) that made the system reboot immediately after
displaying the QEMM logo.  Consquently, since your system was working
& does not crash immediately on boot (from your description) I would
suspect a marginal ram chip might be the cause in this case, but you
never can tell.

Subject: Protection strategies (PC)

I have just spent a couple of days removing the Jerusalem B virus from
files on a 3Com/3+Share network.  In the process, we discovered the
existence of the Stoned and Stoned II virus in some local drives, and
the Alameda virus on some diskettes.  The problem, aside from the
infection itself, is the following: administrative and academic
computing (i.e. students and faculty) are on the same network.
Administrative computing is ready to keep students off the network if
our infections re-occur, and in fact, the last infection found
indicated that this occured through student stations (which have no
hard disks).  Because we use start chips, it appears that shields
cannot be used on these stations.  Some of the strategies we are using
are as follows:

1.  Already, students cannot generally get on the network and use
their own software.  The menus system is locked, although anyone
knowing how to get to the shell from a software package can of course
bypass the protection.

2.  To avoid infecting the network should a student use outside
software on various stations, we recommend that all stations be turned
off after use so that nothing stays in memory (Jerusalem B survives
warm reboots).

3. Administrative and academic usage will be kept on separate servers.
We had one network utility which required an open directory that was
shared between the two sides, and I think that this is how the
infection migrated.

4. Until the infection, WordPerfect was in a single open directory.
Now it is in a read-only directory, but linked to its SETUP files in
an open directory.  The common wisdom around here is that write
protected files can get infected, but files in read-only directories
will not be infected.

Question: Should such strategies suffice for most viruses, or am I
indulging in some wishful thinking?  For those programs requiring
read- write directories, would it help if they were kept on segregated
partitions or is such a separation of no importance?  Any comments
would be appreciated.

Subject: Trojan horse that attacks Laserwriters?

At New York University, we are apparently experiencing difficulty with
foreign code attacking our laserwriters.  We think that code may be
being inserted in postscript headers that are sent to Laserwriters and
that either: (1) continually write the EEPROM until it wears out; or
(2) sets a password inside the Laserwriter that interferes with
access.  It could also be a bug in postscript, or other phenomenon.
Does this sound familiar to anyone?  What's the cause of (and fix for)
what we are experiencing?

  Sure. Norton thinks that anything "strange" is non-movable because
it might be copy-protected. MSDOS.EXE is (last I looked) a 1-byte
file. Now it is not possible to have a 1-byte EXE. MS-DOS sees an
invalid header and loads it as a .COM, but Norton doesn't know about
that.

  If you call Norton, you might ask them about a program called
"SDPROBE" which will tell you lots of useful things about why files
are not movable, as well as debugging information about SD itself.

Most likely, Norton's sd is looking for a combination of System
attribute bit and one of the names that the DOS programs can have
(IBMBIO, IBMDOS, MSDOS and IO) without checking the file extension (as
far as I know, all of these have a .SYS extension).

Of course, if the MSDOS.EXE file doesn't have the System bit set, then
it might be looking for the name on any executable file.  An easy test
would be to copy some text file to MSDOS.COM and see if Norton's flags
it as unmovable.

In any case, it's probably just a bug in the program.

The reason that MSDOS.EXE was listed as unmovable is because of a
"feature" of Norton's SD that lets you specify files which will not be
moved.  MSDOS.EXE is, by default, specified to be unmovable.
Apparently Norton wanted to be sure that no one has renamed their
MSDOS.COM system file to MSDOS.EXE.  (Or perhaps he was afraid that
future versions of MSDOS would use system files in EXE format).

To allow MSDOS.EXE to be moved you must do (from SD)
1) Set Options
2) Unmovable files
3) Remove the stupid filenames

It's as easy as that.  Removing a file name from the list of unmovable
files will not change the file attributes nor will it make system
files movable.
