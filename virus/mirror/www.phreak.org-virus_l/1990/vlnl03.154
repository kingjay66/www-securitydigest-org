VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: UK virus centre proposal

Just a quick not to say that I am intending to submit a proposal under
the UK Department of Trade and Industry Advanced technology program to
establish a UK centre for virus research.

The proposal encompasses a range of problems related to computer
viruses, including:

  o Provision of a central UK monitoring and reporting location
    to which industry, commerce and academia can report new viruses
    and seek general advice on anti-virus procedures and software

  o Provision of a bulletin service (possibly by electronic as well as
    conventional means) warning of new strains that have been detected,
    and the likely activation dates for existing strains

  o Service to the research community such as work on disassembling
    new strains, tracking developments in camouflage techniques, assessment
    of vulnerability of new OS and software environments to viral attack.

  o Liason with commercial organisations and government organisations
    working in the field, including the provision of a point of contact for
    foreign agencies.

The centre would also attempt to raise the level of awareness of the
virus problem through seminars, conferences and other means. It is
likely that the brief would also include acting as a reporting and
co-ordination centre for worms active on wide area networks.

The proposal will be for 3 years funding centred at two Universities
in Lowland Scotland (Stirling and Heriot-Watt). At this stage I am
interested in compiling a list of organisations who would be
interested in the establishment of such a centre, and would co-operate
in the exchange of information with the centre.

A meeting is scheduled for September 11th with the DTI, thus an early
response would be appreciated.

This is certainly a cause for concern to me.  As a Macintosh user and
system administrator, I am reasonably well acquainted with the various
Macintosh viruses.  It is my understanding that, as far as anyone can
determine, every Mac virus has caused problems not by design, but
rather through bugs which led to problems with specific applications,
or the system in general (which is not to say no Mac virus has ever
been written with malicious intent; simply that said intent has been
on a much smaller scale than the actual effects of the virus might
indicate).

Subject: Re: 1701/help (PC)

Well, from the jist of the discussion so far, it appears I was wrong
about the *exact* cause of a 1701 error.  But, the problem is still of
a hardware nature, and not logical or virus related.  In this case, a
track 0 backup wouldn't do any good.

If it's a controller or wiring problem, as some have suggested, then
the drive is still ok, and no need to restore anything.  The reason I
suggested a physical drive error is because I know someone who had the
misfortune of a 1701 error.  My recollection of the account was a
physical drive error.  My apologies, I should have looked it up first.

In any case, a virus this is not.

O.K.
Anti-Virus Virus:

1) Morality
   I have no moral stand on this.  If the earnest goal is to improve
the computing community then and anti-virus virus may be a good idea.
I have read a lot of attempts to compare human vaccine methods with
anti-virus viruses.  The analogy between biological and human viruses
is another point of hot debate on VIRUS-L. Let's hit that issue first.
   An analogy need not be perfect, it should, however, be useful.  The
biological/computer virus analogy is useful.  For example, in
searching for a moral stance on anti-virus viruses several people here
have talked about the Salk and Sabin vaccines.  Sadly, there has been
much misinformation.  The good news is that the issue is being
corrected by some better informed writers.  It happens that the polio
vaccines are not a good example for spreading protection without
informed consent.  I appeal to the medical community to give us a
better example.  Maybe a bioethics person can help.  In the case of
disease I suspect the good of the community comes first.
  There are other very useful aspects to the hydrocarbon/silicon virus
analogy.  The analogy works because now we can use words like:
infection, spread, and replication, rather than having to invent new
terminology.  The analogy must, and does, fail at times.  Yet a
certain amount of flexibility in our interpretations can be quite
useful.  For example, while it is true that the computer has no
inherent immune system, the operating system itself has certain
properties of 'resistance' to infection.  The introduction of programs
like SCAN can be viewed as evolutionary steps in the creation of an
immune system.  The signature search of the antivirus programs is
remarkably similar to certain functions of the mammalian immune
system.  Thus the organism is not the computer itself, but the
computer, operating system, additional software, computer operator,
and programmers who distribute the software.  The computer is just the
site of the infection.
  To finish the morality issue.  It must first be possible to create
an antivirus virus that is a significant benefit to the (computer)
society without unacceptable damage to either computers or civil
rights.

2) Reality
  I especially like the discussions on the difficulties and risks of
producing a 'good' virus.  Many of the opinions expressed come from
people who have already made up their minds on the whole issue, but
the comments themselves warrent merrit.  We need to first agree that
risks can never be zero, then try to decide what the minimum
acceptable risk is.  If the risk is far below the risk of getting an
'evil' virus, and the risk of damage is far below that of 'evil'
viruses, then there may be some justification for thinking a safe and
effective 'good' virus is possible.  How about this: What if all the
standard antivirus software was set up to identify this 'good' virus,
with a standard method of detection and removal?  Then only those
(foolish) people who do not use detection programs will become
infected.
  Unexpected interactions between 'evil' and 'good' viruses is an
important consideration.  Also, the danger that a 'good' viruses
acting on unusual systems in a bad way could cause damage, is food for
thought.  There have been many other valuable comments on VIRUS-L.

3) Utility/Necessity
  If a virus outbreak is out of control because there are too many
casual users who are infected, then an antivirus virus specific for
that virus may become a necessity rather than just a utility.  The
future of antivirus viruses may be highly specific programs to aimed
at attacking especially bad viruses.  The least we could do is
experiment with these programs until we feel that we have the
expertise to write a good one.  Someday we may need it.

AZX@NIHCU                                  do not necessarily reflect
                                           my own, let alone anyone
                                           else's.

Wrong! Word "KONIEC" is perhaps from Polish language and mean "THE
END".  As I said before, whole text was "The end of the program".

Whatever happened to Dr. Brunnstein's MAC Virus list that was supposed

DOS lists (which he did release in late June).

Subject: EEPROM BIOS (PC)

The newest generation of motherboards now being designed for PCs will
be using EEPROM or other reprogrammable devices for the BIOS.  The
goal is to allow BIOS upgrades using floppy disks or even by
telephone.  Has anyone considered the potential virus-related risks
associated with this move?

Subject: Anti-virus viruses

	As Knox points out; some like the idea of AVV's, and some don't.
Unlike Knox, I do believe that this discussion has had merit and
people have changed their minds.  I have received e-mail indicating
this.  I just hope that more people don't like the idea now than before,
and that less people like the idea of AVV's now than before.
	Knox also points out that we may be seeing vaccines turning up.
I believe that we, society, morally and legally, should be prepared
to treat the authors of vaccines as authors of viruses are.  Admittedly
that is not too harsh, but perhaps that will change in the future.

Some comments about the Indonesian viruses...
>     * HACKER

This one is known as "Ohio" elsewhere in the world - It is closely
related to The next one - using the same "buggy" method of formatting
track 40 and storing the virus code there.

>     * DENZUKO

Known as Den Zuk. In addition to the information in the original
message it must be added that the virus removes "Brain" and "Ohio"
from diskettes, replacing them with copies of itself.  The virus
changes the volume label into Y.C.1.E.R.P, but as YC1ERP is the
call-sign of a radio-amateur in Bandung, Indonesia, he is suspected of
being the author.

Both viruses are not able to format 1.2M or 3.5" diskettes properly -
damaging the contents instead - the claim that "No damage come from
this virus." is far from being correct.

>     * MARDI BROS

Reported in France, and originally believed to have been written
there.  This virus contains the text "sudah ada vaksin" (Vaccine
already exists), which I recently asked about.

>     * AMOEBA

This virus has been known for some time, and detection/disinfection
programs are available.

>     * MYSTIK

This virus is known under the name of "Liberty".  Detection and
disinfection programs are available.

>     * PC CLUB
>     * AREMA
>     * SEMLOHE and KEONGZ
>     * PC MONSTAR
>     * ROBERT/NARWIN
>     * SUPERNOVA
>     * FREDDY

None of those viruses are yet known in the West - maybe we can expect
a flood of Indonesian viruses soon.....  :-(

Dear ameteur linguist,

Rorschach is a Swiss town at the Bodensee (lake of Constance),
where this test presumably has been developed.

> As for the question about the word "KONIEC" meaning anything,
KONIEC (spelled in various ways according to language, but pronounced
nearly identically) is found in South-Slavic languages, notably
Serbo-Croatic, and if I'm not mistaken also in West-Slavic languages
(as Polish, Czech and Slovakian). It's meaning is "end" (noun).

So do I.
