VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Low level format (PC)

Many of the articles I read on recovering from a virus infection
recommend a "low level format" of the hard disk as part of the
process. What is a "low level format" and how does it differ from just
using the DOS FORMAT command?
Thanks in advance for any information.

Subject: Utilities?

Can someone tell me where the best place to get the utilities neccessary
for de-arcing and unzipping the programs would be?  For example, I now
have v59 of scan and clean, but don't have the unzip program. Can someone
help me out here as to an ftp address where I could get the neccessary
programs? Thanks.

Subject: bogus Amiga program: 'VirusX 4.4'

A notice has just been posted on CompuServe, by one of the sysops of the
Amiga Technical Forum, that a program purporting to be "VirusX 4.4" is
in circulation.  This is a bogus program!  The current version of VirusX,
as verified by its author, is 4.0.

No details of what "4.4" might do were mentioned.

Nope!  There is no direct Internet FTP access for most people in the UK.
We have our own file transfer protocol known as NIFTP (or just FTP to
its friends) or 'Blue Book'.  It does not interwork with the Internet
and you can't use odd mail addresses like that given above.

If you need to access Internet FTP from the UK the NSFnet-Relay provides
a service of sorts but I don't know if it's public (yet?).  Mail
Postmaster@uk.ac.NSFnet-Relay (...@NSFnet-Relay.ac.uk for folks outside
the UK and some folks inside) for details.

Most anti-viral s/w is available in the UK - see the monthly sites
postings.

          first disassembly and review makes it look like a harmless
          prank, but I'd still recommend that you do not run the program
          at this time unless you are absolutely certain you know how
          to prevent any potential dangers to your files ...

          apologies if you feel that this was an unnecessary alarm,
          but it seemed the lesser evil to pass on a false warning to
          waiting for 5 days to confirm it.

You could remove the stoned virus with McAfee's clean program or more
simply, by booting off a clean dos disk and use the sys command to
transfer a new copy of the MS-DOS system onto the hard disk.

          1) boot system on a clean disk
          2) sys c:
          3) "Stoned" virus is gone !

That's all.

Subject: another trojan called "Virus Info" (Mac)

          shortly after the first 2 trojans showed up on "that Canadian BBS"
          a third (but technically different) one showed up - and I do not
          believe anyone reported it publically yet (and I had hopes to
          snarf the "evil ones" with it. alas ....)

          This trojan claims to also be from the "DeathTrack" group as were
          the first two.

          it will *IMMEDIATELY* destroy your disk(s) - and I assume if anyone
          had run into it, we would have heard about it by now ...:-()

          well, if anyone sees it show up ANYWHERE (or any other program which
          you suspect after running it and finding your hard disk unusable
          immediately afterwards, for that matter) please let me know.
          (you do keep copies of all new software you download on more
           than one place, don't you?!!  else, if you execute it and it
           destroys the disk it was on .... right.  you can't send me a
           copy for analysis!)

Subject: VirusX Trojan (Amiga)

A friend of mine here at SUNY-Binghamton just informed me of a message
that was posted to CompuServe recently.  I've no idea as to how valid
it is, but it's better to be safe than sorry, even VIA 3rd-hand news.

It seems that somebody has released something called "VirusX 4.4" into
the public domain.  THIS IS A BOGUS PROGRAM, and may be a trojan.
According to Steve Tibbett (sp?), the author of VirusX, the most
recent version of the disinfectant is 4.0.

Just thought you might like to know.

Subject: VirusX Trojan (Amiga) More Info!

With regards to my earlier posting about the bogus version of VirusX
(version 4.4), here is the original text.  It originally appeared in
comp.sys.amiga and comp.sys.amiga.tech.  I thought that my posting was
a little sketchy, so here's a (slightly) better one.

- -----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----8X-----
There is a file going around now that supposedly has a new version of
VIRUSX.   The archive says the file has version VIRUSX 4.4 and that it was
released on March 10th.

I've done some analysis on the files in the archive, and the archive
appears to have the same executables as VirusX 4.0.  The doc files and
the C code in the archive talk about two viruses that are supposedly
"harmless".  It appears the messages were put there to lull people into
a false sense of security.

I've contacted Steve Tibbett he has confirmed that this archive was NOT
released by him.  He's working on a new version of VIRUSX, but this is
NOT IT.

WATCH OUT FOR THIS BAD ARCHIVE, AND LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT!

Official VIRUSX releases are posted to ALL the national networks by Steve
Tibbett, or by an official agent.

No more "hard info," but at least it's a confirmation that the darned
thing exists, and that it is probably trouble.

Hi all!

I think I already know the answer to this one, but could anyone
comment on Mac viruses infecting VAXen file servers.  It would seem to
me that this is impossible, but we'd like a more practical view.
Thanks.
