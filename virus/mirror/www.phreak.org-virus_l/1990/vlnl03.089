VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,

contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to

Subject: anti-virus video information?

Does anyone have or know where I can get some videos on Virus protection
and virus information.  I know about the internet worm paper (by the way,
where can I ftp to get it??).  Is there any other on-line papers on this
subject that anyone would like to share???

Subject: Stoned, Jerusalem-B, And Alameda Infections... (PC)

   I'm a proctor at a student PC lab at Northeastern University in
Boston, MA.  We recently have had a large-scale infection of the Stoned, and
Alameda Viruses.  I know what the Stoned Virus does, but I'd be interested
in getting some information on the Alameda Virus.

   We have also had a small scale infection of the Jerusalem-B Virus.  I'd
would also like to know what the affects of this virus is.

   The lab that I work in has been using SCANRES and VSHIELD very successfuly.
I have also been able to remove students' viruses and viruses off of hard
drives using CLEAN.  The problem has not been a major hassle as yet, but
it has been an inconvience.

Subject: downloading viurses - protection (OS/2 and DOS)

My boss has asked that I find out something about a product mentioned
in InfoWorld Magazine, the April 30, 1990 issue, page 32.

It is called Hyperaccess/5 and has been updated to include virus
detection.  The article says "During a file download, if the virus
filter detects a known virus' characteristic signature....(it) notifies
the user..."

Has anyone used this product?  Is it worth the price being asked?  Are
there any hidden problems other than having to uncompress files to
make it work properly?

Thank you for any comments on Hyperaccess/5 version 1.1

  I was walking through a rather large local SEARS store the other day
and noticed that a couple of their PC clones on display had hung
during boot with the classic "your computer is now stoned" message.

  I brought this to the attention of the salesman, and he said
"yeah... I've noticed that before.  Most of the other ones do it too
occasionally."  He wasn't even that sure what a computer virus was,
but was "qualified" to sell PC's to anyone who would listen.

  I don't know whether or not the local SEARS does installation/set-up
of systems for their customers, but something like this (particularly
with uninformed sales personnel) could serve as an unwitting, but
large, distribution center for viruses.  Most likely it's on all of
their boot disks, and probably their originals.  Not a pretty picture.

  I directed him to get in touch with the CC here for info on programs
that could get rid of them (I wasn't about to attempt to describe
CLEAN to him and how to get it).  I hope he does...

You bet it's possible.  Turbo User Group publishes a newsletter/journal
called TUG Lines, and in issue #35 (published very recently) a method
of doing exactly that is presented, both in C and in Pascal.  The code
there is written for MS-DOS machines, and even supports programs that
store variables in their .EXE files.  Both versions should be able to be
ported to other machines with a minimum of trouble (I've done something
similar to it on UN*X machines).  The code has been placed in the public
domain.  For information on obtaining a copy of that issue of the journal
you can write to them at Turbo User Group, PO Box 1510, Poulsbo, WA 98370
USA.  You can also call them at (206) 779-9508.

Original-From:         David Tal <GSRGAAO@TECHNION>
Original-Subject:      Virus circulating around Haifa

                                                 5.4.90
 Chevre,
    Just to make you aware, a virus has been circulating somewhere in PC's
 around Haifa, and you should be on the lookout for it.  It is the "4096"
 virus, otherwise called the "100 year" virus.

     It is not too terrible a virus, although nobody wants to have them
 around at all.  I have not spent a lot of time characterizing it, but I
 can give you a little information (not carefully documented) about it.

     The virus manifests itself by adding exactly 4096 bytes on to the end
 of a .EXE, .COM or .OVL program.  Infected .EXE programs are directed to
 the end of the file with the IP set to 0001H (bytes 14H and 15H of pgm
 header) instead of other values.  In addition, the last 4K contain the
 strings, "0EH,07H,BFH,52H", near the beginning of the 4k virus block, and
 "50H,12H,65H,14H" near the end.  Searching and finding these strings will
 pretty much prove that the virus is present.

     The virus is rather insidious, in that it somehow gets into the DOS
 operating system, and causes it to give erroneous program size values
 when you use the DIR command.  It can be spread by calling not the
 infected program itself, but by any other program which is called while
 the virus is present in the DOS operating system memory.  The virus also
 infects COMMAND.COM.  The virus does not seem to spread simply by copying
 or examining an infected program.  Fortunately, if infected programs are
 repeatedly called, the virus never causes the program to grow by more
 than 4096 bytes from its original value.  I am sure that there are among
 you people who know a lot more about it than I.  These are just casual
 observations.

     The virus can be readily removed using available programs.   Perhaps
 some of the users know of public domain programs which will remove it.
 After removal, the original program usually has a few bytes extra left
 over from the way it was originally.

     Finding things like this are particularly distressing and disgusting,
 since all of us have better things to do.

                                                  David Tal

To Continue David Tal's warning,
There is a virus circulating now in Rehovot, Nature Unknown but origin
is known - The Kaplan Hospital, where it destroyed several PCs disks
and such.

Subject: New version of F-PROT (PC)

Version 1.09 of my F-PROT anti-virus package is now ready.

I just sent it to SIMTEL - it should appear in the TROJAN-PRO directory as
FPROT109.ZIP soon.  I will also sent it to everybody on my mailing list
later today.

The major changes from version 1.08 include:

    * Corrections to F-DISINF and F-BOOT to handle sector sizes other than
      512 bytes.

    * Corrections to F-OSCHK.  It did not work properly with DR DOS.

    * Changes to F-MMAP.  It now displays the usage of expanded memory,
      and lists device drivers present in memory.

    * Detection and removal of several new viruses: PrintScreen, Korea, VP,
      Amoeba, Prudents, Virdem, 8-Tunes, Kennedy, XA1, Pretoria and Durban.

    * Adding the F-NET program to provide better Novell network support.

The number of virus variants the programs can detect and remove depends on
how the word "variant" is defined.  If minor variants, like Payday and Anarkia
are counted as independent viruses (as some prefer to do), the total number is
somewhere near 150.  If related viruses are grouped together (for example
Pixel=Amstrad), the total is near 70.

Subject: How are PC viruses related ? (PC)

As the number of PC viruses increases, it becomes more and more difficult
to keep track of how they are related to each other.

Below is an attempt to clarify the virus relationship somewhat. The viruses
not listed are considered not to be related to any other viruses.

Please send me any comments, corrections or additions you may have.
