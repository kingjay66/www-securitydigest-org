VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Hi,
Can any of you answer Stuart's question/s below?
Some other places for help are:

1) Home base BBS 408-988-4004 where programmers working on anti-virus
software+ communicate/hang-out (Can we drop email to it from internet?
If so, plz tell me address!)

2) virus-l newsgroup: subscribe via listserv@ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu or
listserv@lehiibm1.bitnet

3) then there are different place for comp. types= mac, ibm, apple, ?

4) there is also an National Security Agency-National Institute of
Standards and Technology 24-hour emergency room-- ouch--I only have
the info on that at work and not at home SO, if anybody needs that AND
it does not get posted by someone else--send me an email and I can
send that to you on Monday from work.

  My hard drive also has the same problems.  It will read fine, but
will not write.  if anyone else has had similar problems, please
write, perhaps the problem isn't hardware but a new virus?  Or maybe I
am just getting all excited for no reason..  Anyone who can help, I
would greatly appreciate the help!  Thanks.

Subject: Cambridge virus (PC)????

A friend of mine has what he thinks is a new virus called the
Cambridge virus.  He discovered it when he went to change the clock
back to standard time.  This seems to have triggered the virus which
destroyed the FAT area on his hard disk.

Now the strange thing about this thing is that from what he has been
told is that this virus does not reside on the disk, but in the
computer (maybe clock ram??).

Has anybody heard of this thing?  Is it possible to create a virus
that resides in ram?

Any help in getting rid of this beast would be appreciated.

Thanx,

Scott

Subject: Stoned-virus (PC)

Some time ago I received a 5.25" disk (containing source-code,
OBJ-files and .EXE-files) which I copied (using XCOPY) to the
harddisk.  I have used both the .OBJ and .EXE files.

Later I found out that the disk contained a virus.

SCANV67C reports that the BOOT sector of the disk (placed in A:)
is infected by the STONED virus, but no viruses are detected on
the C: drive !

Questions:
    1) Is my C drive clean ???
    2) Is it safe just to copy the files to a new (clean) disk ?
    3) If 1) and 2) have negative answers - what should I do ?????

I'm sorry if these are trivial (stupid) questions but this is my
first encounter with a virus.

Please E-mail   ( I6FINN@VAX87.AUD.AUC.DK )

Speaking personally as a software author, buy software from the
manufacturer or a legitimate dealer. The same fears you have are felt
by them manyfold, and great care is taken to insure safe software.
Although you threw out names of companies freely, none of them has
distributed software with any problems. Why fear a problem that does
not exist. Viruses are spread by individuals copying software, not by
legitamate manufacturers.

Subject: Help! Policy recommendations sought.

At Arizona State University, we have put together a "Network Virus
Committee" to examine virus related issues and hopefully develop some
polices and guidelines.  I'm hoping some of you may be able to assist
me in gathering information that would be of use to our committee.

There are several things that would be of tremendous use:

1) Information from any other colleges, universities or other
organizations that have addressed these same concerns on a campus wide
basis.  Specifically, final reports or recommendations on issues like
education, prevention and eradication of viruses would be useful.

2) Polices for interconnecting LANs - specifically, we would like to
have guidelines for departments that wish to connect their LANS to a
recently installed Ethernet backbone at ASU.  Our concern is that
network administrators take proper steps to keep their networks clean
and ultimately, prevent the spread of viruses across the backbone.

3) Any recommendations on articles and other literature appropriate to
this area.  Are there any places to FTP articles from?  Also, we are
interested in finding some knowledgeable individuals to come and speak
to our committee and perhaps other members of the university community
about these issues.

4) Specific recommendations on software to help in the detection,
eradication and prevention of viruses for network servers,
workstations, and stand alone machines would also be helpful.
Ideally, we'd like something that is effective, adaptable and
relatively inexpensive (as most you know, university budgets can
impose a BIG restraint!)

The platforms we are most concerned with are DOS (Windows, etc..),
UNIX, and Macintosh.

Any information any of you can provide on any or all of these areas
would GREATLY be appreciated!!  Thanks!

Gee, Kevin: one can look upon viruses as the most efficient means to
spread data amoung a population of users.  It is well known that the
most efficient means for a spread of data amoungst the OS/2 population
would be for one user of OS/2 to hand the data disk to the other OS/2
user.

Dos fakes redirection pipes by creating a temporary file on the disk,
and writing to it.  Newer versions of dos have a function to make a
temporary file.  It is created from the time and date stamp, and is a
hex number.  When you do a dir | more, Dos creates a scratch file to
put the output of dir into.  More then takes that, and apparently uses
a scratch file or perhaps Dos creates 2 scratch files.  In any case,
it is a standard feature of DOS, and not to worry.

Subject: Re: Is this a virus? Help! (PC)

rem@cs.bu.edu wants to know if the files which show up when he does
  dir | more
are a virus?  No, they are evidence of the difference between Unix and
MSDOS.  The "|" is a "pipe" between two programs, passing the output
of one into the input of the other.  In Unix, the pipe is handled
somewhere inside the system; in MSDOS, it is handled by re-directing
the output into a temporary file and then re-directing the temporary
file into the next program.  Unfortunately, MSDOS has a tendency to
leave the temporary files lying around.  This is especially true if
you abort the more output with a ^C.  When you own a dog, you have to
be prepared to use a "pooper-scooper" occasionally!

I have experimented quite a bit with Jerusalem-B but I have never seen
it survive a warm boot. Could anyone explain to me how it is possible
for any virus to survive a warm boot by any method other than
infecting something on the boot disk. In my experience a warm reboot
always re-initializes the interrupt vectors, a process that no virus
in memory would survive.

The only method I can think of is by intercepting the Ctrl-Alt-DEL
keystroke and doing a reboot with int 19h, this would be difficult
because it would require the virus to store the original interrupt
vectors before anyone could alter them and hide in the top of the
system memory. The only type of virus that could perform this would
probably be a bootsector-virus.

If a virus would use the above method it would probably alarm even a
novice user because the system would no longer go through the BIOS
startup tests.

Maybe the 386+ processors have capabilities that make other methods
possible?
