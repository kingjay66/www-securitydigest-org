Subject: Steriod Trojan -- WARNING!

Steroid Trojan Horse

There is a Trojan Horse called "Steroid".  It is an INIT that claims to speed
up QuickDraw on Macintosh computers with 9" screens.  The INIT contains code
that checks for the date being greater than June 6,1990.  If it is, it will
ERASE all mounted drives.

I have performed some tests on a Macintosh SE.  Having Comm Toolbox installed
seemed to interfere with the INIT and keep the erase from happening.  The SE
simply crashed.

I then installed the INIT on a floppy disk and booted the SE.  The floppy and
hard disk were promply erased.  NOTE: I had set the date to 7/7/90.

So far, we know that the code does the following:

OPERATIONS AT RESTART:

 DATE & TIME CHECK (Loop)
 SYSENVIRONS CHECK
 GETS VOLUME INFORMATION (probably checking for HFS)
 GETS SOME ADRESSES (Toolbox traps)
 DOES SOME HFS DISPATCH OPERATIONS
 VOLUME IS REINITIALIZED to "Untitled"

INFORMATION:
- ------------
TYPE:      INIT
CREATOR:   qdac
CODE SIZE: 1080
DATA SIZE: 267
ID:        148
Name:      QuickDraw Accelorator
File Name: "  Steroid" (First 2 characters are ASCII 1)

WHAT TO DO:
- -----------
If your disk becomes erased, you can use SUM II Disk Clinic to recover the
deleted files.  We have tried this and it seems to work.  If you read this
today, before June 6 1990, REMOVE the Steroid INIT from all disks IMMEDIATELY.

Subject: re: Stoned (PC)

Yep, the Stoned installs itself on the bottommost sector of the
physical disk, which is the place where the partition table lives on a
partitioned hard disk.

That's only sort of true; the DEBUG "load" command can only
see within the DOS partition, and therefore it can't see the
bottommost sector; but I think people were suggesting using
DEBUG to type in the tiny program needed to do the work.
For instance, if you go into debug and type

a 100
xor ax,ax
int 13
mov ax,0201
mov bx,0200
mov cx,0001
mov dx,0080
int 13
<enter by itself>
g 112
d 200 3ff

you'll be able to see the bottommost sector of the first hard disk,
including the partition table and the master boot code, sitting there
at address 200.  (Only do this if you have some idea of what you're
doing, of course!  The wrong typo in the above could easily make your
hard disk inaccessible.)  Similar tiny programs can read the original
stashed bottommost sector on a Stoned-infected hard disk, and write it
back to where it belongs.  I think that's what some folks were
suggesting...

A new version of the scanning program, including new search strings,
was released the other month; ask your IBM marketing rep, or local
branch office, about the IBM Virus Scanning Program version 1.1.  (If
they can't find the information about it, give them my name; it's sort
of an unusual product...)

That's a common symptom of the 1813 (or "Jerusalem") virus, one of the
most common PC-DOS viruses.  Have you used a virus-scanner on your
system?  If you *do* have an 1813 infection, the other symptoms that
you're seeing are probably due to various bugs in the virus and/or
"incompatibilities" between the virus and your various programs...

          It seems to me that this is also a new way to compromise the
security of IBM equipment.  A better, more secure method of dealing
with the problem (ie. not a "trick") should be found and implemented.

Subject: "validate" program for Macs

Does anyone know of a "validate" - type program for the Macintosh?
I'm looking for something similar to McAfee's VALIDATE program, which
is used to generate two checksums on a file, with independent
algorithms.  Thus when the file is transmitted, the checksums
generated before transmission are compared to the ones obtained after
transmission, to ensure that what is sent is received uncorrupted.

Thanks in advance for the help.

Subject: MDEF anyone? (Mac)

Since the initial report, there's been a conspicuous LACK of any reports of
MDEF/Garfield hits.  Have they just not made it to the list?  Has Garfield
been contained?  Is it spreading undetected?  Inquiring minds want to know.

I posted a query to the Virus SIG in the Mac Utilities area of America
Online, and got this:

Subject: Steroid Trojan and SAM 2.0 (Mac)

For SAM 2.0 users:

As recently reported, a new Trojan horse named Steroid has recently
been discovered. It is set to go off on July 1st, 1990, at which time
it zeroes your volume directories (it is possible to recover files on
hard disks with utilities such as SUM II). Before that time the Trojan
remains dormant.

This Trojan is shipped with the file name (Steroid) preceded by 2
invisible characters along with a warning not to change the file name.
These 2 invisible characters are there to make it load before SAM (or
other INITs). If you leave this file in your system folder, then you
are in danger (especially if have not renamed it).

If you have renamed the file so that it runs after SAM (in general, NO
unknown INITs should ever be allowed to run before SAM), then in
advanced or custom modes you will get SAM alerts saying "There is an
attempt to bypass the file system" when this Trojan attacks your
volumes. Denying these attempts prevents the Trojan from doing any
damage.

You can enter the following virus definition in Virus Clinic to allow
both SAM Intercept and Virus Clinic to detect this Trojan during
scans.

   Virus Name:  Steroid Trojan
Resource Type:  INIT
  Resource ID:  148
Resource Size:  1080
Search String:  ADE9 343C 000A 4EFA FFF2 4A78    (hexadecimal)
String Offset:  96

If you have entered this definition and have renamed the Trojan to run
after SAM, then SAM Intercept will also notify you when this INIT is
run at startup time.

Yes, that is true, there has to be some trust someplace, but too much is
a bad thing.

- -You're not the first person to think that maybe it's the commercial
 anti-virus
- -programmers who are writing viruses. In fact, you're wrong. Also, don't you
- -think it's judgemental to single out a product like SAM and suggest a
- -malicious motive lurks behind its development and distribution?
- -

- -The facts are:
- -1) The SAM author has never written a virus;
- -
- -2) The author spends a huge amount of time and energy making the product as
- -   powerful as possible for the benefit of SAM's users;
- -
- -3) The author would be making his living on other software if there weren't a
- -   need for SAM. Contrary to your thought, many people consider his effort a
- -   service to the Mac community, not a scheme to bilk the Mac users!
- -
- -4) SAM 2.0 was upgraded to allow SAM users to get better defense against new
- -   viruses at no cost. Once the virus definition is entered by the user,
 there
- -   is next to no chance of becoming infected even unknowingly.  And the
 proper
- -   virus definition is posted usually within a day of the discovery of a new
- -   virus. All registered SAM users are send a postcard with the proper virus
- -   definition free of charge. Symantec has even stopped its subscription
- -   service since there is no need for it.
- -
- -5) It is somewhat true that upgrading SAM for virus removal requires a modest
- -   $15 fee. BUT, this simply covers Symantec costs. It was judged too
- -   dangerous for the user to enter his own repair information, and posting a
- -   program that would update SAM with the repair information could lead to
- -   someone using the program for a Trojan Horse. Hence, the decision was made
- -   to distribute SAM 2.0 as you now see it.  In the future, something even
- -   better will be done...
- -
- -In short, the SAM author has nothing to gain from writing a virus, and also
- -does not have the time, energy, or motivation to write a virus.
- -
- -Rich, I am an honest person, trying to make an honest living. And from my

I apologize for singling out SAM in that way, but I was aiming the
article at the entire market, not just the single product.  SAM was an
example, it was not to be portrayed as a criminal.

I had only realized that a great amount of trust is being put in the
hands of large corporations, and the two words "trust" and "large
corporation" do not commonly appear in the same sentence.  I am not
trying to say that we should not trust Symantec or any other such
company, I am saying, though, that we, as consumers, should not put
our entire trust in any large corporation, no matter how good the
cause.  I pointed out a rather large blind spot in the consumer mind.

You mention that you are an "honest person, trying to make an honest
living," and I truly believe you, but can you say that about everyone
within the Symantec Corporation?  What I am trying to say is that
there is always someone out there who will think of another way of
making another dollar.  It may not be within the Symantec corporation,
but there are other companies out there, and there are many people
working for each of those companies.  It would be very incorrect to
say that each of those employees, at least the higher-ups in the
companies, would never consider or try implementing such an idea.

Just as a side note, I am a proud owner of Symantec's Anti-Virus for
the Macintosh, and I have been testing it for building-wide
implementation/ installation here at Siemens.  I personally feel that
SAM is the best virus protection utility out there on the market to
date.

I have seen two or three different announcements of the newest

date would be today, Jun 6, 1990.  The last message, from the SAM
