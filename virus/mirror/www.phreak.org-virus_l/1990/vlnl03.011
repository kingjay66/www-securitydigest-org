Subject: Trojan Horse???? A new one

I recently saw a posting about two new sharewares, JCremote and Mac II
Diagnostic Sound.  After unBinHexing and Unstuffing them, I did what most of
would, I checked for viruses using SAM Virus Clinic 1.3.  No known viruses were
detected.  I tried the Mac II Diagnostic Sound and then installed JCremote.  As
I installed JCremote into my system folder SAM 1.3 warned me about attempts to
modify the system file, however, this is not uncommon with a CDEV or RDEV.
After installing it, I opened the chooser and selected JCremote.  The system
froze.  When I rebooted the computer the computer started to launch, but the
crashed.  There was no bomb or any message, just a blank screen.  After
rebooting with a floppy and checking with Disinfectant 1.5, the system file was
noted as having a damaged resource fork.  This meant I had to install a new one
.

I am not sure which of the two mentioned files are the culprit.  The first time
it happened I heard a sound which sounded like one of the Mac II Diagnostic
Sound sounds and the freeze occurred when I tried running JCremote.

          If you have a virus on your system that reproduced your master
diskette, that virus could infect the copy.  If the store that
re-sells your software takes off the shrink-wrap, tests the program
and re-shrink-wraps it, there is a chance of a virus infecting it
there.  If someone buys a package, takes it home and discovers it will
not work on his system and returns the software, the store
re-shrink-wraps it and sells it for new.  Yet another way to infect a
disk even though it was sold 'shrink-wrapped'.  Do we have to put all
software in tamper-resistant packaging like Tylenol?  If a store tries
a package out so they can be able to tell customers how good it is,
can they sell that diskette as new software still?  Do we have to
demand a no-returns policy on software?  Hey, the customer might have
a shrink-wrap machine available to them and would be able to
shrink-wrap and return as new.  Where do we draw the line?
Shrink-wrap doesn't mean virus-free!

Subject: Re: Shrink Wrap...still safe?

Many large retailers (and some wholesalers) have shrinkwrap machines.
They use these to rewrap packages of software that endusers may have
purchased and then returned.  They may also rewrap software packages
that they have been using in-house as demo programs.  They usually do
not check the diskettes to see if they have been modified with a virus
or other nasty.  The purchaser usually has no way of knowing if the
package they have just purchased has been rewrapped in this manner.

Additionally, there have been some commercial distributions shipped
with a virus on the diskettes.  Usually, this contamination occurs in
the stages where the diskette is formatted or copied, not when the
master copy of the software is produced.  That is, the machines doing
the copying are infected and they introduce the infection when they
copy the master version onto the diskette.  Most software houses are
now aware of this problems and they take greater care to protect
the machines used to produce the distribution.

Words of advice:
   Get in the habit of using virus scan programs on EVERY new diskette
   you add to your system.  It will only take you a few extra minutes
   but may save you a great deal of trouble.  Establishing the habit
   is very good practice.  Keep a virus monitor (e.g., Gatekeeper,
   FluShot+) installed on your system and activated just in case.

   Point out to your retailer/wholesaler that should you ever buy a
   product from them with a virus on it, introduced because they have
   re-wrapped an infected product, they are liable for damages in a
   lawsuit.  Encourage them to label any package so rewrapped -- then
   be extra careful when purchasing same.

The 1813 virus is sometimes referred to (here, in the news, etc)
as the "Jerusalem" virus.  So if VIRSCAN says you have the 1813,
information about, and disinfectors for, the Jerusalem virus
are appropriate...          DC

Subject: Implied Loading and Accidental Destruction (Mac)

Bob Woodhead noted the distinct possibility that a useful resource in a
"non-application" file could be accidentally trashed by GateKeeper Aid
or a similar program which kill executable resources.

First, I assume that Chris J. was careful enough to include a list of
"don't do that to this file type/creator" entries (I can't check today,
my Mac's dead :-( ), or maybe a list of file types that should NOT
contain executable code resources.

I think the *idea* is good; I'm sure that he put more thought into
the implementation than I did in my glib oversimplification of its
functions. I was just trying to explain why it was that the ADBS
resources were being trashed by GK Aid.

For those who may have missed the beginning of all this, GK Aid
will kill off code resources (and WDEF, PACK, etc. executables)
in files in which they "don't belong". Deciding what "doesn't
belong" is, of course, the kicker. Bob is very right about the
possibility of damage to "non-standard" files.

Of course.  Just replace the "halt" instruction with a sequence of code
to insert a virus (or to perform any malicious action).

The approach to addressing the problem of viruses is not to automatically
analyze code, but rather to prevent the propagation of viruses.

This aside, turning to what I'd intended to say when I started this

This surprises me, since I bought a copy of this program at Reiter's
Scientific Bookstore in Washington DC last November, and used it on my
PC for a couple of days (before getting inspired by it to write my own
programs...  some of his algorithms he gives in the manual are really
hard to figure out, since he's optimized them for integer arithmetic and
he doesn't show all the simplifications he did, only the final
result)...  since then I have used the PC everyday, and have run one of
the virus-checking programs on it several times, without any indication
of a problem! Does anyone have details on which particular virus this
is, or what is added to the end of the object files that one can check
for? I'll run the virus-checking program on the disk itself this evening
to make sure, but from the (very limited) evidence it looks like either
not all the copies of the program are infected, or this is not one of
the standard viruses.

Subject: WDEF and Virus Detective 3.0.1 (MAC)

Hi,

     This past week we have had numerous infections of WDEF A.

     I noticed some odd behavior by Virus Detective 3.0.1

1) Open Virus Detective and select 'autocheck disk on insertion'

2) Insert a diskette known to be infected with WDEF A

3) When the scan detects the virus, click Continue to finish the
   scan.  Now drag the disk to the trash to eject it.  The diskette
   will remain infected until the desktop is rebuilt on it.  The hard
   disk is untouched, though.
      If, however, instead of clicking Continue, you click Cancel
   and eject the disk in the same manner, the virus immediately
   infects the hard disk.

Any one else had this problem?

Subject: An unfortunate victim (Mac)

The latest MacWeek (9 Jan) has an article on page 10 that describes
the latest victim of the problem of electronic vandalism.

1st Aid Software, publisher of Anti-Virus Kit (which recently acheived
notoriety as being the only Mac Anti-virus application that
effectively detected and prevented WDEF *before* WDEF was isolated)
has announced they will issue no further updates to the application.
Their line of reasoning is the same as Don Brown's for not updating
Vaccine.  1st Aid does not wish to get into an ever escalating battle
of more sophisticated tools s. more sophisticated threats.

I'm sorry to see this happen.  While I believe we are essentially
fighting a "staying effort" with vandalism today, walking away from
the problem will not stop the continuing evolution of electronic
threats.

Although I agree with Brian McMahon's response (Virus_L 9 Jan 90) that:

I think there is a more subtle problem here.

If U. Mich is like most universities, they place a great deal of emphasis
on COOP work terms and Summer Faculty Research programs at government
agencies and corporations around the US.

Since most of these people bring their own programs and utilities along
with them, a laissez-faire attitude toward viruses is like not doing
anything about head lice.  It may be easy to do at home, but can be
embarrassing if you go some place else.   Once these people get to their
prospective sites and infect a few computers, they may find that their
sponsors are unwilling to take a similar risk next year.

I can say from experience that the cost of eradicating a virus at a large
research facility usually costs more than the money spent sponsoring the
faculty fellow, or coop.  Therefore, even though no one may directly say
so, the amount of problems you cause with a naive attitude about computing
could have a bearing on whether, or not you are invited back.  (Please
don't take this thought out of context and try to flame on me for it.)

Something any university should be concerned about is the concept of "Guilt
by association."  I have listened to several people who used to
(incorrectly) associate Lehigh University with virus problems.  Fortunately
Lehigh is now developing a reputation for their efforts in the area of
virus control.  But I think you understand the point.

Now, there are a few minor guidelines that anyone can follow to reduce
their chance of taking viruses, or malicious programs with them when they
travel.  Although the methods are not foolproof, they should reduce the
risk to a more acceptable level.

1.  Don't bring bootable floppies with you when you go to a new job.  There
    is usually no need to boot someone else's machine from your floppy and
    it will go a long way toward stopping boot infector viruses.

2.  If you have written programs to use while you are there, bring the
    source code and recompile your programs at the new location.  It is a
    reasonable way to prevent viruses and will avoid problems you may have
    with OS version differences.

3.  If you use public domain software, try to download copies from the
    Organizational BBS at your new location, if they have one.  Most large
    institutions today have a designated BBS system which is frequently
    checked for viruses and malicious programs.  And if you find that you
    are infected anyway, at least you know where you got the software from.

4.  If you must bring executable code with you, ask your sponsor if there
    is a procedure for checking software that comes in.  Usually this
    function is centralized and associated with other help functions that
    you will probably need in the future.  Anyway, by asking, you will show
    yourself to be a knowledgeable and concerned user.

5.  NEVER bring pirated software with you when you go to the new location.
    There is nothing worse than finding out that someone infected your site
    with a piece of software that they weren't supposed to have in the
    fist place.  Most large organizations already have all the software you
    should need and have huge software investments to protect.  Prudent
    organizations would see this as cause for immediate dismissal.

I hope this helps.

Subject: RE: Shrink wrap...still safe?

Craig,
   When you buy software in a computer store that is shrink wrapped, it may
not have always stayed in that condition before *you* bought that software.
There are software stores (at least in the Washington, D.C. area) that will
re-shrink wrap software packages when they are returned.  For example, if
someone bought a software package, took it home, and didn't like it.
They could take it to the software store who would take the software back
as long as the software still had the documentation AND the registration
card.  They would take the software and offer an exchange or refund and send
the customer on his/her way.  Then the store would take the software into
the backroom and procede to re-shrink wrap the software and put it back on
the shelf.  I (as the customer) had an experience like this.  I returned a
piece of software that I was not what I thought.  The store I bought it from
was more than happy to assist me (keep the customer happy).  They asked if
everything that came in the box was there, which of course it was.  Then the
sales clerk SPECIFICALLY asked me if the registration card was in the box.
Again, I assured him that everything was there.  He explained that he had to
ask about that because they were going to put it back on the shelf and re-sell
the package.  I asked if he could sell it without the shrink wrap on the box,
to which he replied, "Nah, we have a shrink wrap machine in back" (not
necessarily a direct quote).  I thought about that, about specifically asking
for the registration card.  I could have pirated the software and sent in the
card as though I *actually* paid for it.   But then  I thought a little bit
more about the whole transaction.  The clerk never looked in the box when I
was standing there to see if everything was in it.  After refunding my money,
he took the box in back, wrapped it, and brought it back before I left the
store.  He could have looked while he was in back, but I don't think he did
because he was not gone for very long.  Also, he never asked to see a sales
recipt.  There was no price tag on the box (it was shrink wrapped when I bought
it and the tag was stuck to the wrapping which I threw away) so he wouldn't
have known for sure if I even bought it at his store - if I bought it at all.
I could have stolen the software, pirated it and get *my* money back.  Or I
could have stolen the software, INFECTED it, and then get *my* money back.
The store and the software company would have never known - neither would the
unsuspecting customer who might have bought that software.

**JUST FOR THE RECORD**
I *did* pay for it, and I *did* have my sales recipt with me when I returned
the software.  I was *not* satisfied with the program.  And, I did *not*
pirate it and did *not* infect it with anything.

          Postscript fonts are executable files.  Like any other postscript

They are for the mostparts, encrypted, but the encryption and decryption

Shrink wrapping is a form of encapsulation that reduces the risk that
software will be contaminated and increases the probability that
tampering will leave evidence.  The vendor of software has an interest
in an orderly market place and in the reputation of his product.  If you
have evidence that the product has not been tampered with since the
vendor shipped it, then you may rely, in part upon his interests.

Shrink-wrap that is applied by the vendor would help to serve that
purpose.  However, few original vendors use labelled shrink-wrap and
many distributors and retailers can apply shrink wrap.

Since much software is poorly labelled, since it is hard to demonstrate,
and generally difficult to buy, Many retailers have adopted a
"Trial/Return" policy.  Under this policy a purchaser is permitted to
return software  for a full refund within a limited period of time.  The
retailer re-wraps the software and returns it to the shelf.  Most such
retailers are simply naive, a few are irresponsible.

The risk to the retailer is that the "purchaser" will simply make a copy
of the software and return the original media and documentation to the
retailer.  However, the retailer can measure this risk.  The risk to
subsequent purchasers of the used package is that the media was
contaminated before it was returned.  This risk is harder to measure and
is not to the person making the decisions.

Vendors can help by using labelled shrink-wrap.  To the extent that
users come to expect such labelling, the re-wrap strategy becomes less
effective and efficient for the retailer.  Users can protect themselves
and discourage this risky practice by refusing to deal with retailers
that offer them the right to return.

Subject: F-PROT clarification (PC)

Since I made the F-PROT package available, I have received a
considerable number of messages containing the same questions over and
over.

So, here is an attempt to clarify a few details:

        When new viruses appear, you do not have to obtain a new version
        of the program. It is only necessary to add a single line to a
        file. This line contains an encrypted signature string with a
        checksum. The programs will then be able to find any infections
        by the new viruses.

        I will create this line and post it here on VIRUS-L/comp.virus.

        However, you need a new version of the program if you want to
        disinfect a program infected with any of those new viruses.
        I have to write a disinfection routine for each virus - a task
        that sometimes takes as little as five minutes, but in other cases
        a full day of work.

        The tiny (2K) .SYS file that prevents the execution of any infected
        program must also be updated to stop new program viruses.
        It should, however, be able to detect any new boot sector viruses
        without changes.

        The list of viruses the program can handle ...

                Agiplan, Alabama, Alameda (Yale), Amstrad, April 1., Brain,
                Cascade, Dark Avenger, DataCrime, DataCrime II, dBase,
                December 24th, Den Zuk/Ohio, Disk Killer (Ogre), Do-Nothing,
                405, 4096, Fumble, Fu Manchu, Ghost, Icelandic/Icelandic II/
                Saratoga, Jerusalem/New Jerusalem/Sunday, Lehigh, MIX1,
                New-Zealand (Stoned), Oropax, Perfume, Ping-Pong/Typo,
                South African "Friday 13.", Sylvia, SysLock/Macho, Swap
                (Fallboot), Traceback/2930, Vacsina, Vcomm, Vienna/Lisbon,
                Virus-90, W13, Yankee Doodle and Zero Bug (Palette)

        ... does not quite match other lists of known viruses, but in most
        cases this is because different names are used for the same virus.
        There are, however, a few viruses that have been reported but not
        made available for research. They are obviously not included (yet).

        The documentation includes a description of all the viruses, even the
        most recent ones like Amstrad, Perfume, Virus-90, W13 and Vcomm.

        The suggested contribution of $15 is for a single copy - for an
        organization which uses the program on more than one machine, the
        suggested contribution is $2 for each additional copy.
