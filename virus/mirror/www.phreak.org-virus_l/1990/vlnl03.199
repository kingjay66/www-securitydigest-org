Subject: LZEXE- drawbacks (PC)

I have read several responses to my input on LZEXE, critical of what I
had to say. I have three responses.

1. I recognize the fact that if you LZEXE'd a file that had already
been infected it could hide the virus. This is another good argument
for regular scanning. I have LZEXE'd almost all of my software, and
feel safe about it, because I have had most of it for quite a while
and the software I use has proven itself safe because of years of
regular use and frequent virus scans with the most up to date software
I can get my hands on. If you can feel as safe about your software
before using LZEXE as I did, I personally believe that LZEXE can add
some more security.

2. You're probably right about stealth viruses. I hadn't thought of
that. Good idea. However, that doesn't rule out the possibility that
it could help find or pervent non-stealth viruses.

3. LZEXE is not compatible with MS Windows programs (this is
explicitly stated in the documentation) and is not usually compatible
with programs that use overlays. However, I myself have only hit one
program (excluding windows) that I could not successfully put through
LZEXE, which was Telix, the shareware communications program.

I apologize to those people who have requested LZEXE from me and have
not yet gotten it. I just got a copy of UUENCODE and will be mailing
LZEXE to everyone who requested it within the next day or two.

Thank you all on the virus journal for your constructive comments.

Subject: WARNING* Stoned on demo disk from the company -> LAN Source (PC)

SCAN 6.0V71 Copyright 1989-90 by McAfee Associates.  (408) 988-3832
Scanning boot sector of disk A:
  Found Stoned Virus [Stoned]  in boot sector.
Disk A: contains 1 directories and 4 files.
 Found 1 file containing a virus.

Over the past couple of weeks, I've been trying out SCAN.EXE and I
just found a virus on a free DEMO disk I ordered through LAN TIMES.  I
just for the heck of it scanned the diskette and was shocked to find a
virus!  I promptly called (416) 866-8575 and told the guy at LAN
Source that I found the virus and he should call up McAfee Associates
at (408) 988-3832 and purchase their software and scan the disk for
himself.  The free DEMO 5.25" diskette is:
 MODEM Protocall(tm)       ***NOT FOR RESALE***
 ONE MODEM EVALUATION VERSION
 NOVELL IPX & NETBIOS VERSION
 JUNE 02, 1990
(c) 1990 PROTOCALL COMMUNICATIONS, . . . , ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WORLDWIDE
The Company that sent me the diskette:
 LAN Source Technologies Distributing
 526 Queen Street East
 Toronto, Ontario M5A 1V2
ORDER DESK TEL: 416-866-8575

I want to point out that Kevin (the person I talked with) was very
nice and very co-operative. Also, the software looked decent once the
virus was removed. They are going to rush me another copy of the Free
DEMO Disk without the virus on it.  I guess these viruses are becoming
a real pain!  Lucky for me my hard disk was not infected.  I can't
even trust DEMO Disks to be virus free.  I did: SCAN C: (no virus),
took demo disk out and put it in machine for the first time, SCAN A:
(found [stoned]), took out disk, SCAN C: (no virus) then clean a:
[stoned] (removed virus from demo disk).  Maybe this event will help
me justify the college getting some kind of virus protection.

I have also run into the same problem with WP5.1 files.  I think the
problem is a crosslink problem.  I read in the most recent VIRSUM that
there is the 4096 virus that can cause this type of problem but
checking with McAfee's Scan v7.1 I find there is no virus present.  I
am curious if there seems to be a problem with WP5.1 itself.  I know
of another person with the same problem.  I am curious if John or Jean
operates WP5.1 under Windows 3.00?  I have a hunch that maybe wp5.1
and Windows do not seem to get along too well.  But then this is with
any real basis, this is just a thought.

Subject: *WARNING* [stoned] on demo disk (ONLY 20 copies went out) (PC)

I just got off the phone with Mark (the owner!) of LAN Source
Technologies Distributing.  He is personally calling everyone who
received the infected diskette.  Only 20 went out.  It seems someone
made a mistake on their last day of working at the company and sent
infected diskettes out.  Mark said that they have a copy of the McAfee
Associates software.  He appoligized repeatedly and I feel like WE CAN
TRUST that they are NEVER going to let a virus go out on a disk again.
So the *WARNING* can be mostly recalled. He asked if there was
anything he could do for me and I was tempted to ask for a free full
blown copy of the software but I desided to tell him "Just keep the
viruses off of your disks". My advice is to scan anything you get from
any place.  And of course, register the virus scanning software.

Subject: Novell virus? (PC)

I know a company which has strange problems under Novell:
They get lots of zeroes (=ASCII 48) into their ASCII-files where they
don't belong. In fact, in some files, one in 500 bytes gets corrupted in
such a way that bit number 4 gets set to 1. (So the 48 comes from
32 +16).
Might this be that there's something wrong with the
installation or is this phenomenon already known as a virus?
Excuse if this has been discussed on this group before, but
I'm new here.

Subject: re: Software boot protection (PC)

In response to CON_JDC@SELWAY.UMT.EDU's query about boot protection:

We have a package called Protec which includes software boot
protection. It is good against users trying to do damage to the hard
disk intentionally.  However, an advanced user who wants to do some
real harm can do a low-level format quite easily. Regarding virus
protection, when a student boots from a floppy and tries to access the
hard disk, an "Invalid drive specification" message is shown. It does
everything that was stated in your message, EXCEPT, it does not
protect against most computer viruses.

Two viruses which I have seen infect a Protec'ted hard disk include
the Stoned and the Ping Pong B virus. Both of these boot sector
viruses infect the hard disk and I would assume any other boot
sector/partition table virus would do the same. The hard disk,
however, would be protected from COM and EXE infecting viruses since
DOS doesn't know that the hard disk is there.

When booting from a "Stoned" infected floppy diskette, the virus in
fact disappears. It is not present in the hard disk partition table. I
have not checked to see if this virus stays memory resident. I do know
that he Stoned virus was definitely there because physical sector 7
contains the original partition table, an effect of infecting the hard
disk. I suspect that there are two partition tables and that the
appropriate one is selected when booting from a hard disk or a floppy.

The Ping Pong virus does something totally different. When booting
from a "Ping Ponged" diskette, the virus gets copied to the boot
sector et cetera like normal. Trying to boot from the hard disk later,
the machine is unable to boot.  If you try to boot and then put in any
number of floppy diskettes, the diskettes will all become infected. If
you boot from a clean floppy you can access the hard disk but the
volume label shows garbage and a FAT error occurs (some major side
effects!). Cleaning the hard disk will restore everthing to normal.

I'm not a DOS expert and maybe someone can explain to me why these
things are happening but I figure the virus doesn't care if drive C:
is a DOS disk or not. Because of the boot protection, anything should
think that the hard disk is not there except for software manipulating
physical sectors. A low-level format and Norton Utilities can both see
the hard disk. I would assume that viruses read and write physical
sectors.

This is not a direct response to your question but rather an overview
of what happens when boot protection is employed.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Author of Scores to be charged (Mac)

The Dallas prosecutor's office is going to move ahead and file charges
against the author of the Scores virus.  To help get a handle on the
scope of the damages done by the virus, they would appreciate hearing
from people who have had the Scores virus.  The information will not
be used on an item-by-item basis in the trial, and you won't be called
as a witness -- they have lots of hard evidence already.  However,
they need some information to show that the virus has caused extensive
damage outside of EDS (where it was originally released).

If you are willing to help with this effort, send a letter to
	Lt. Walt Manning
	Dallas Police Dept.
	1840 Chestnut. St.
	Dallas, TX 75226
Include specifics on when your system(s) got hit with the Scores
virus, any damage it did, and approximately what it took in terms of
time and expense to clean your systems.  Other data relating to the
infection will also be appreciated.

According to Lt. Manning, he would also appreciate (separate) letters
from people on company/school letterhead stating that viruses such as
Scores are major problems in the computing community and their authors
should be prosecuted under appropriate law, if feasible.  Nothing
extreme here -- he needs some rational, reasoned letters of support
"just in case".

Lt. Manning says they've discussed it some and expect the suspect to
plead guilty when shown the evidence they have against him.  They are
probably going to probably seek a suspended sentence along with
community service and a public apology.  They don't believe that
extended jail time will help here, but they want to make it clear that
writing viruses is a wrong thing to do, and if caught the authors will
face punishment.

Subject: Defeating Virus Scanner Trojans

The rash of trojan "new" releases of virus scanners is worrying.  I
wonder whether it might not be possible for virus scanner developers
to employ public-key encryption to provide unforgeable proof of the
validity of new releases of their product.

The scanner developer would checksum his program using a (preferably
complex) check-summing algorithm.  The check-sum and the file size
would then be encrypted via public-key encryption and released with
the program itself.  The person attempting to subvert such a program
would be faced with the task of making their subverted program the
same size with the same checksum.  They could not simply compute a new
checksum and install it because they would not know the scanner
developers private key.

A PD program could be provided for computing the checksum and checking
it against the file.  This program could be provided in source code
form.  The scanner programs could also include the ability to check
new releases, so that a user once certain of the validity of a release
could then readily check new releases.

I would be interested in comments on this idea, especially from the
virus scanner developers.

Subject: Musicbug virus (PC)

I was infected by te Music bug virus from an SVGA utility disk from
Taiwan that I got from my local dealer when I bought a new machine
from him.  The infection occurred when I accidentally booted the disk
in my old 286 (thankfully beloning to my employer).  It is now in the
shop, as it will not show signs of recognizing the CMOS.  This might
be a coinsidence.  In any case, I got SCAN71, and it does not dectect
the virus.  Mapping with PCHSELL shows the MusicBug v1.06, MacroSoft
Corp message in sector 52 of disk 1 and in sector 30 of uitility disk
2.  This virus is there.  And Scan71 doesn't find it, opinions to the
contrary.

Subject: *NIX virus... necessary knowledge. (UNIX)

Greetings...
        For the last couple of weeks I saw a number of inquiries about UNIX
oriented anti-virus utilities.  A couple of comments:
Exercise #1.  (some knowledge of unix assumed)  Sit down in front of a
        terminal.  Using man pages/manuals write a substitute login program.
Exercise #2. (as above)  Write a substitute crypt() routine.  Compare your
        results to those of the original crypt() - they must be the same!
Exercise #3. (regardless of your knowledge of *nix) Write a program that is
        capable of switching from regular to priviledged mode and back without
        the knowledge of the os.  (real hardware...)

If you can do number 1, you are good.  Better than most.  If you can
do number 2, you are excellent - work for the NSA, they'll pay you
more than you're getting now.  Fortunately, to write a VIRUS that will
function in a UNIX environment, you must be able to accomplish number
3.  If you can do number 3, you will not waste your time writing
viruses, you will be writing operating systems for AT&T.  There are
some very basic precautions that can keep a UNIX system safe as could
be.  The security is already there - only people must be trained.  The
biggest security problem in UNIX is the superuser.  If that account is
handled with care, rest assured - any infection can be fully
contained.

On the other hand, the world is full of sick sick people.

Subject: MS/Dos vs. different viruses, job market (PC)

While I know that many of you out there despise MS/Dos with all your
hearts, or call it a dinasaur or such, I was wondering how effective
the Format program is for removing a virus from a disk (yeah, it's
overkill, but if you have back- up copies and if it works, best to be
safe).  Also, for the viruses that break into another program and hide
within it, what would happen if you delete that program from the disk?
Are either of these measures effective for eliminating viruses from
computer floppy disks?  Would it work against these "legendary"
stealth viruses (I swear, from what I'm starting to hear, pretty soon
they will be using the modem on their own to spread...), or sector
viruses?

I asked this once before, but it was ignored in the rest of my post, I
guess.  What kind of jobmarket is there for computer programmers who
specialize on detecting and eliminating viruses from other systems?
Is it a job that one can make a decent living at?  What languages
(Computer) are best suited for combatting viruses?  And who
(Corporations) would hire a computer anti-hacker?  Thanks for all your
help.
