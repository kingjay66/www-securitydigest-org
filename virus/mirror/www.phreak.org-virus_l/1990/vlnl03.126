VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: anti-viral product summary

I am putting together a list of anti-viral software products for a
large conference in October, and I would like to maintain the list and
make it available to whomever.  I see the list as objective, stating
basically what the product does and its features, but no subjective
opinions or categories of "best" or "okay" a la Consumer Reports.

To get a head start on this, I would GREATLY appreciate it if those
who have compiled similar lists would let me use their's as input to
mine.  Equally, I would like to receive product information from
vendors including those who deal only in shareware/freeware.  I will
make the list available for download and ftp, and notify this list
when it's complete.

Thanks in advance, John Wack - National Institute of Standards & Technology

Subject: 4096 virus information (PC)

The following is a forward from John McAfee:
========================================================================
	Raymond Glath's posting about the 4096 in Dallas implied that
this was the first documented case of the 4096 here in the States.
Far from it.  The 4096 was first detected at Washington University
in St. Louis nearly 6 months ago and since then has been reported
at over 100 sites involving many thousands of computers.  Some well
publicized incidents of recent infections include the entire
Monterrey PC User's group (through an infected distribution
diskette), 13 Burger King franchises in Scotts Valley, CA and Santa
Cruz, numerous IRS offices in Seattle and one of the nation's
largest banks based in Houston.
	The Dallas infection further validates most researcher's
concerns that this virus has become geographically disperesed and
will become one the more prevalent viruses very soon.

I see recommendations to advance system dates past a Friday the 13th. I
suggest that this is dangerous as this is exactly what a lurking Saturday the
14th (Durban virus) is waiting for. Until such time as there is a Sunday the
15th virus, advance clocks by 2 days and not one. Better still is to clean
your system on Thursday the 12th. (That is until there is a Thursday the 12th
virus !)

Subject: remac.exe and the Jerusalem Virus (PC)

I recently downloaded remac.zip from one of the ftp sites (I think
it was cc.ucsf.edu).  Anyhow when I unzipped the file I found out
that remac.exe had the Jersualem-B virus on it.  I used the MacAffee
scan and clean program, and the clean program worked just fine.  Got
rid of the virus and saved the program.  So if you have downloaded this
zip file check the exe file when you unzip it.

Subject: Is this worth $75? (PC)

Someone told me that his product:
1. COMPLETELY protects against invasion of operating system viruses;
2. Prevents the spread of file viruses on hard or floppy disks; and
3. Searches out and suppresses file viruses.
How much protection does this give? Is it worth $75?
Thanks for any answers/comments.

Subject: Cleaning up after infection (PC)

If something in the boot sector is different, then it certain doesn't hurt
to look through it.  However, your explaination of a SYS with another
version of DOS is possible.  It is also possible that a buggy program
wrote something into the boot sector.  If there are sensitive or
important data, back them up, put a clean DOS back on the hard disk,
and hope for the best.  The more you try to play with a possible virus,
the more likely it'll do some harm.

/\_Someone writes...
>Question....

It is different in that Stoned2 has different messages and is not
detected by most of the programs that detect the original Stoned
strain.

>I found a couple of my floppies that were "infected" in the boot
>sector with both.  Using VirusSCAN (V64), I got the following:

This occurs because of a mistake or misunderstanding between here
and McAfee Associates.  Simon sent a search string to McAfee that
occured in both strains.  McAfee took this to mean that the string
only occured in Stoned 2.  So if you have STONED in your boot sector
then SCAN64 will inform you that you have Stoned and Stoned2.
We suggest in the meantime that you use NOSTONE or FPROT111 which
both detect and remove the virus correctly.  NOSTONE currently is
the only program which detects double infections (which occur when
Stoned and Stoned2 clash with each other).

Simon has sent a new search string to McAfee that only occurs in
Stoned 2, so hopefully the next release of SCAN will be corrected.

Subject: General virus scanner (Mac)

More on this thing about a "general virus scanner".

It might not be a simple thing to implement on the mac, but, as
opposed to the PC, most viruses on the mac are self-contained in their
own resources in the resource fork. One could try and find resources
that "look" the same (in some criterian or other) in different
applications. Some resource types would have to be excluded, though
(Like, STR, STR# &c...)

The question is: how many viruses would this catch ?  (it all depends
on the matching criteria) How many false alarms would this trigger ?
Also, some standard libraries (like "MacTraps" in THINK C) arepart of
many widespread applications, and must be excluded as well, and now we
aren't general anymore.

Input on this subject would be much appreciated. You can reach me as
h+@nada.kth.se (NOTE: Other addresses VOID except where prohibited by
law :-)

I noticed in the Disinfectant 2.0 Doc. a "Frankie" virus is mentioned.
I have never heard of this virus.  I would be most appreciative if
those having information on "Frankie" would send what they have to me.
Thanks much, Regards,

  I don't know what you mean by "Scanres checked out ok at 640K", but
if you'd read the instructions which came with Immune, you'd find that
it says:

  "Note: On some machines (e.g. PS/2, HP Vectra), IMMUNE (and CHKDSK)
will report less memory than is nominally available.  For example, on a
PS/2 with 640K, IMMUNE will report only 639K even when no virus is
present.  This is due to an extended BIOS area.  In order to be certain
that the deficiency is not due to a virus, perform IMMUNE immediately
after booting from your original (write-protected) DOS diskette.  If
you find only 639K you know that the missing 1K is not due to a virus,
and that 639 is the parameter which should be supplied to IMMUNE."

  So the chances are good that you don't have some mean and nasty bug,
and the moral is: "If all else fails, try reading the instructions."
