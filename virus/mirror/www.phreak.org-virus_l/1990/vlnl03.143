VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Odd string "DIES" appears in allocated memory map (PC)

A user's PS/2 model 70 was brought to us recently.  It simply locks up
(dies?) after a few minutes, even if it hasn't yet completed the boot
process (e.g., before the boot password is entered).  A 201 error code
suggests that the problem is with the memory modules.  However, we
observed that when the machine is booted from the user's hard drive,
the MAPMEM utility reports that a program named DIES has been loaded
just 0x83 bytes past the DOS-EDIT utility (i.e., it has apparently
overlaid DOS-EDIT), and has stolen the INT-21 vector from DOS-EDIT.

We are treating the first as a hardware problem, but we are curious
about the "DIES" string.  Is this familiar to anyone (and, if so,
is it possibly related to, or the cause of, our "hardware problem")?

OK, the "bouncing ball" effect >is< a characteristic of a virus, but
the "small bugs" visual effect is (to the best of my knowledge) not.
A small TSR .com file called "bugres.com" is responsible for this
effect.  When the program is installed pressing Alt-B will invoke the
visual effect.  It's really a lot of fun to watch, and it is NOT a
virus!  (Unless, of course, somebody has hacked into the code)

Subject: Antivirus viruses

        I am a sophomore here at Lewis & Clark College in Portland,
and I work in the campus computer support services.  I have been
subsribing to the comp.virus journal for a few months now, mainly to
keep an eye out for any information about viruses that we may have to
brace for out here.  Up until now I have never felt inclined to submit
anything to this journal.
        However, this new discussion on the ethics of producing
viruses to kill harmful viruses is a fascinating one.  Peter Ukra from
somewhere or another (I am not yet Unix-path fluent) posed an
interesting argument against the use of antiviruses.  If antiviruses
become an accepted phenomena, there is nothing to stop those perverts
who write the viruses from writing new ones that will initially
convince the user that they are a "good" virus before turning around
and doing some form of damage.
        The scenerio Ukra uses is one where a virus pops up on a
user's screen, identifying itself as a "virus that hunts down others"
and gives the user a choice -- press "A" to proceed with the hunt, or
"B" to delete this virus.  If the user presses "A," the virus may show
its true colors and inform the user that it has just erased his hard
disk.  Thus, there is an apparent danger in producing two kinds of
viruses (good and bad).
        My point is this: How many "bad" viruses do you know of that
ask the user if he wants to delete it before it does anything?  None.
        Let's examine that scenerio and a couple of different
possibilities for it:
        #1) The virus really DOES turn out to be a "good," virus-killing
        virus.  The user wins if he choose either "A" (begin hunt) or "B"
        (delete virus).

        #2) The virus only says that it's a good virus, but it is really
        a badnastyevilugly virus.  There is no guarantee, and in fact it
        would be naive to assume, that the virus would actually delete
        itself if the user chose "B."  Seeing as how most if not all of
        today's badnastyevilugly viruses don't give any options at all --
        they just erase a disk, etc. -- I don't see where the new and
        urgent danger is.

        My point is I don't see any additional danger the average user
is put into with the innovation of antiviruses.  Yes, it gives the
virus perverts another way to make fools out of computer users.  But
the only difference between, say, a WDEF virus and this "Virus Hunter"
virus in the scenerio is that a little more text is dumped on the
screen and the user feels a bit more foolish when the virus erases his
hard disk.  Any other virus would have done the same thing and would
never have given him the cute little option greeting in the first
place.
        Viruses don't have to ask for user permission to infect files.
Viruses do not spread by beguiling computer users; they simply hide in
the shadows and slither from disk to disk.  I see no new dangers users
could find themselves in if antiviruses do in fact make an appearance
in the computer world.

Not entirely true.  Part of the 'resentment' (if you can call it that)
comes from the fact that the organizational license is rather restrictive.
I certainly support all of McAfee's efforts and also believe he is
certainly entitled to renumeration.  However, my understanding is that
much of the license fee is based on support calls from  users.  There
should therefore be some provision whereby a college/university can
designate a local support person  and pay a smaller fixed fee for
the license.

I see the inflexibility as being the primary culprit.  I realize that
other software vendors charge a heck of a lot more but then again we
can simply ignore them in many cases.  Also, with alternatives like
F-PROT and the IBM VIRSCAN that cost substantially less it is real
hard to justify major expenditures or overhead-laden cost-recovery
to our administrators.

Again I want to say that I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT Mr. McAfee's efforts
and agree that he is absolutely entitled to make whatever rules he
wishes regarding his product.  However I believe that Mr. Powlesland's
analysis is a tad simplistic.

INT 40h should definitely be included, it might also become necessary
to check INT 0Dh and INT 0Eh at some point in the future.

I would like to add: [...] under certain trigger conditions.

Something else: Does anyone know of a virus scanner that examines high
memory (as used by 386max and similar utilities) for "stealth-type"
viruses ?

Subject: Re: Responses to F-PROT query

Well, it is nice to know that people like my programs, but I just wanted to
add a few comments about F-PROT.

    Version 1.12 is the latest available, but it is not 100% up to date.
    The reason is that a number of new viruses arrived while I was on
    vacation, and I am busy adding the detection/removal of them to version
    1.13, which will be distributed sometimes around Sept 1. Detecting the
    viruses is of course just a matter of finding a good search pattern, but
    writing a disinfector for every virus takes a bit of time.

    The viruses not detected by 1.12 include some of the latest Bulgarian
    viruses (2100, the Bulgarian "Tiny" family) as well as some recent
    viruses from Taiwan, and a few other (Joshi, Casper, Anti-CAD and
    Subliminal + a few more).  I am working on bringing the program up to date
    again, but it will take me a few more days.

    Some people have complained that the programs are a bit hard to use and
    install.  I know - I know.... :-)   I am working on what I call version 2,
    which is much improved in this area - Menus, auto-install etc.  

    I have not yet had the time to finish version 2, but when I do, I have
    do decide whether to...

    ...turn version 2.x into a commercial program, quite serparate from the
    sharevare version 1.x.  The commercial program would of course be more
    expensive, but buyers would get telephone support and a printed manual.

    ...make 2.0 shareware as well - personally I would want to make it
    freeware, but I just cannot afford it .... see below...

    What I do depends partially on how much money I make from registration.
    Writing/distributing F-PROT is no personal gold mine - in fact, my
    involvement in the anti-virus area has probably resulted in a reduction
    in my income - as the virus-related work continues to increase, I have
    had to cut back my work outside the university.

    I have asked people registering a copy for a single computer to send
    in $15.  I have, however, discovered that the work involved in cashing
    the checks and mailing out a new copy of the program takes up too much
    of my time.

    It has also turned out that the amounts I receive are usually either $15
    (single copy) or $500 (500+ machines), so what I am planning to do is
    make the programs free of charge to individuals, using them on a single
    computer.

    Anyhow - I'm not 100% sure what I will do - I just want to spend my
    time programming, not mailing out programs.... :-)

    The problem is also that even though I would like to make the programs
    free of charge to anybody, I have to make a living from this as I spend
    50% of my time on viruses and F-PROT.  Freeware programs may be possible
    on the Mac, with only 10-20 viruses, but on the PC with over 200 different
    virus variants they are totally impractical.

    So, this is the situation.  I must assure you, that whatever happens I
    will continue to support the program and update it in one form or another.

Subject: computer crime:sources and researchers

I am interested in researching the history, incidence,forms of
and motivations behind computer "crime". I'm not certain how
the latter can (should) be defined (hopefully this will be clarified 
in the research process) but I'm interested in system break-ins,
unauthorized copying, computer mediated fraud or theft, and
various interpretations of hacking, as well as any other behaviours
that verge (in some minds) upon criminality.

This is an enormous area, but this I'm making a boots 'n all effort.

Pointers to research summaries, key articles/journals/books and
authorities in these areas would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not particularly interested in the legal situation regarding
these activities- mostly estimates of scale, methods and techniques,
the "kind" of persons involved and what their motivations are.

I'll post a summary if there is sufficient demand.

Please don't flame this possibly naive and uninformed request.
And thanks for any help.
