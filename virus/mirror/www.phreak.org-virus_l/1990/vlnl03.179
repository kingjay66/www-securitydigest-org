VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Indeed! It is most destructive and pretty easy to program, hence it
this sort of damage is one of the favourites of virus writers.

As examples, I've send you the following memo files
(most of them containing descriptions of several variants):
   DATACRIM PCMEMO   (both variants)
   DENZUG   PCMEMO   (cf. variant SYS-B)
   MERRITT  PCMEMO   (cf. ALAMEDA & GOLDEN GATE)
   VIENNA   PCMEMO   (several variants render arbitrary program
                     into low-level hard-disk formatter)
   12-TRICK PCMEMO

Try to identify the beast you are hosting according to the "easy
identification" sections in some of the descriptions, or use virus
scan programs (e.g. McAfee's SCAN, or Frisk's F-DISINF and F-FCHK from
the F-PROT package).

Good luck

Subject: FluShot 1.4 bug? (PC)

Hi,

    I have FluShot 1.4 and sometimes at XT machines it gives the
message "CMOS has been changed". But, as XTs don't have CMOS as ATs
do, anyone knows something about this bug?

Thank you all,

   Carlos.

Subject: Virus specific collection

I hesitate to make this known, but their was a request a while back
for collections of VIRUS-L items grouped by specific viri.  In
addition to the editted collections which I have been making available
for some years, I have also been grouping files by specific viri.
Because of the mass of material to be dealt with, these are not the
last word, but they are there.

In order to obtain the material, please send a sufficient number of formatted,
720 or 360K floppies (yes, that means MS-DOS format) to:
Robert M. Slade
3118 Baird Road
North Vancouver, B. C.
V7K 2G6
with a self addressed, *Canadian* stamped envelope.  Due to the volume of
work to be dealt with, and the past volume of unstamped requests, any future
unstamped packages will not be returned.

Note that the complete collection of virus information, editted into
separate Opinion and Related files now occupies over 12 720K disks,
and the virus specific files (for PC, Mac and Amiga) fill at least two
720K disks.  The files are growing at an average rate of one per month
at present rates.

No, I will not (mostly cannot) mail it all over the net.  No, I will not
send out viral code.  And as previous requesters can attest, it may take
a while to get back to you.

Subject: Norton sd says *NonMovable Blk* (was Curse.exe virus) (PC)

Some days ago someone complains that *curse.exe* (i.e. the tool replacing
the mouse-arrow by a tiger-cartoon-figure in win 3.0) creates non-movable
blocks.

I looked a little in my 386-system and noticed that Nortons *sd* reported
a number of areas marked by X, *NonMovableBlks*!

2 areas was occupied by the boot staff
1 was msdos.exe (i localized it to \windows directory (its the *old*
  win 2.x-like executive)
1 was a lost cluster that could be corrected/removed by chkdsk /f

The only strange thing is why msdos.exe is nonmovable?
- - if I rename it to msdos1.exe the X-marking disappears!
- - I fetched a new copy from MSDOS distrib diskettes (You have to use
  "expand.exe" to uncompress!), and the same occurs - the file is nonmovable
  only when it has the funny msdos.exe-name...

Can someone explain that?????

Paul:

If you dig a bit more, you'll notice that the original Turkish exec and
the 'worm' features are a LOT different stylistically.  There is *no*
evidence contained in the worm itself that it WORM originated in Turkey.

Given the vast difference in coding styles, I would agree that somebody
took a valid program and hacked it to pieces.  However, saying it originated
in Canada (or Japan, or Kuwait, or...) is equally as valid as saying it
came from Turkey.

So far, the infection chain as I have been able to trace it is:

UREGINA1 -> PSUVM -> UICVM -> UTCVM and several other sites
      \--> ETSUACAD

If somebody has HARD evidence of how UREGINA1 got it, I'd be more than
happy to forward it to the appropriate people.

Subject: Is this a MAC Virus attack? (Mac)

The machine:
        MAC SE/30; 4MB & 80 MB Apple drive running 6.04; MAChine purchased
        in spring of 1989; NEVER EVER BACKED UP!!!!! and holding the
        entire financial and planning records of a local dept.
Symptoms:
        Disinfectant 2.3 INIT goes off, WDEF on newly inserted diskette; user
        runs Disinfectant (theoretically correctly); everything seems fine ...
The next morning:
        First time being powered on after the Disinfectant run; the desktop
        comes up as being empty (no icons to be displayed; the message bar
        on the desktop window still reports 41,xxx KB used, 38,xxx KB available
        and indicates a reasonable number of files (~370) using the 41MB)
First Aid:
        Find File can not find any files.
        Apple FILE FIRST AID can not find anything to fix (I think this only
        looks at the desktop file).
        NORTON's MAC Utilities says that the directory has problems; says that
        it can fix the files affected ands rebuild; claims to have done so, BUT
        no files are seen (same state as before - yes I rebuilt the desktop
        after the recover attempt).
The final Solution:
        SUM Utilities are required to get every file, and lots of 'stuff' that
        are/were files (got to get all 79.9MB back).  User is still sifting
        through 'hundreds' of "??MS WORD Doucument No. xx"; some of which have
        spreadsheets and databases stuck in the middle (fragmentation?). Disk
        seems fine (physically). Only clue was that there were at least 4
        different versions of the system on the disk; probably the result of
        poor application install practices ....
Question:
        Does this sound like a virus, or "a random photon from the radio
        galaxy"? - If it's a virus, which one? any other thoughts?  Did I do
        things in the right order?  Was there a magic bit to flip?
Comment:
        I could claim that the user deserved this - after all it is a lot
        easier to recover from a disk/tape then to look at all those files
        at the block level and determine if they should be saved; and we
        push at all levels to get these people to backup - but you know, once
        the data is dusted, some one has got to get it back (on the grounds
        that a few days of my work is better that 1000's of hours of theirs
        from an institutional point of view)
Aside:
        They are now buying a tape drive and I suspect will be doing backups.

Subject: sudden reboot on PC (PC)

Hi,
	I have posted an article on comp.windows.ms sometime ago,
seems like there are quite a few people having this problem, so I
decided to post the problem here also, since I suspect this might be a
new virus or trojan-horse.  The problem is this, it started 2 to 3
weeks ago, my PC starts to reboot itself once or twice a day without
any reason.  At first, I thought it was something about the window 3,
but it proved to be wrong because it also reboot itself under Procomm,
some other people replied to me that their PC reboots even under other
non-communication softwares.  I used scanv67c to check, but it didn't
report any virus and probably wouldn't do so since the phenomenon
started to appear 2 to 3 weeks ago.  I wonder if there is anyone in
the netland has the same problem, and if so, is there a guess of why
this happens and how to fix the problem.  Thanks in advance.

My machine is Zenith 248/12, running DOS3.3+ and himem.sys, smartdrv
installed.

Subject: periodic sighting report

It's been a while since I sent one of these periodic reports out.
Sorry for the delay.

The following new, or otherwise important, virus infections were
reported recently:

- - Ping Pong (PC) reported in Ottawa, Canada.

- - Yale/Alameda and Joshi (PC) in Detroit, MI.

- - Stoned/Marijuana and Joshi (PC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

- - 1554 (PC) reported in California.

- - BITNET TERM MODULE worm (for lack of a better "name") (IBM VM/CMS)
  was reported at a small number of sites (~3-4).  If anyone else has
  seen this, please report it to me.  I'm very interested in finding
  out if this is still active.

These sightings were reported to me; they are in addition to the other
reports that have appeared on VALERT-L and/or VIRUS-L.  When possible,
I have phoned at least one contact in the area to verify the
sightings.
