Josh & whomever,

We have not had any difficulty with the WDEF viruses since we put
GateKeeper and GateKeeper Aid on our MACs. I particularly like the
fact that the program DOES take care of the folks that you mentioned
- -- "Idiots that continue to use the same old infected disks.....". For
those of us that work in educational settings -- GateKeeper and
Disinfectant are a must, in my humble opinion. I truly appreciate the
authors dedication to providing us such fine products -- for free!!

BTW, we also provide a means for folks to get these fantastic programs
at our Micro Center -- they just bring a blank disk and we give them a
locked disk with the programs on it.....

Subject: SafeWord VIRUS-Safe now available thru Shareware (PC)

During the past few months I've posted messages describing our
commercial software for detecting the spread of viruses in MS-DOS
environments. The package is called "SafeWord VIRUS-Safe", and amounts
to an extension to MS-DOS that continuously monitors the integrity of
DOS and all accessible file systems.

Due to the nature of this net, all of my comments in the past have
included a notice to the effect that "this is COMMERCIAL software, NOT
shareware..."

Well, I've convinced my marketing department to let me release this as
shareware. We are still a commercial enterprise and our motives are
still commercial, but we have decided that a shareware distribution
mechanism makes a lot of sense for this product at this time.

Accordingly, I have taken steps today to upload SafeWord VIRUS-Safe to
several public-access BBS systems that will propogate it all over the
world within the next couple of weeks. This is NOT "Crippleware": we
are releasing the same package for which we have sold tens of
thousands of commercial licenses to major banks and aerospace
companies. This is the software I've been referring to that implements
automatic ANSI X9.9 and ISO 8731-1 and 8731-2 Message Authentication
Code integrity checking of DOS and all programs.

I am interested in posting this software to the Anti-Viral archive
sites that I've read about on this forum. I'm in the process of
configuring one of our UNIX machines for UUCP and FTP transfers but I
don't know how long it will take me to complete this task. It's all new
to me. By one means or another, I want to get this software available
via anonymous FTP through the popular servers out there. Anybody that
can send me information to make this task easier will be doing me a
great favor that will be appreciated.

Meanwhile: please be invited to obtain SafeWord VIRUS-Safe, version
1.10 and evaluate and/or license it through Shareware! If you cannot
download it from a BBS, we will send you diskettes for a nominal fee.

Subject: Virus Summary List

As the individual who may have started the current round of the
"mythconception" concerning the capability of Jerusalem B to survive
warm boots, I should point out that the information was taken from the
Virus Summary List of August 1990 (I believe).  Yes, everyone should
have some such information at hand (F-PROT also includes a similar but
less complete description of known viruses), but be aware that the
information might not be 100% accurate.

Subject: ways to circumvent viri attack, maybe

Just a thought,

   What kind of impact would say, renaming com and exe files to
something else while not being used.  Then at least viri that scan the
disk looking for those files to infect would find no hosts in which to
reside.  I used a somwhat simmilar method that had the added advantage
of "increasing" my disk space.  All programs were zipped when not in
use.  When needed, I ran a program that would unzip them into a temp
directory and run a file called "go.bat" that would just run the
program. (or set up directories, whatever would be needed) As far as I
know, no viri infect zips, (boy I hope I am not giving any nasty
projects for these jerks) and any program run will be deleted after
its use, keeping the original copy untouched.  And data files would
also be stored in a zip file automatically by go.bat when finished.
Of course, the zipped files should be cleaned to begin with, otherwise
memory resident viri could affect other programs operation with
unpredictable results.

Anyone see problems with this method?

(other than speed of execution, since it needs to be uncompressed)

STONED is the most common virus we see here - in the four months I've been
in this job it is the only virus I have had to deal with on campus.  (I have
had a couple of reports of Jerusalem that were dealt with by the local DOS
wizards in the departments concerned.)  The only serious problem I've had
associated with STONED was an infected hard-disk becoming "inaccessable"
following disinfection.  (Any attempt to access C: resulted in a "Divide
overflow" error message.)  This was more than likely due to the disinfector,
rather than to STONED per se.

Viruses are nasty, an unwanted nuisance, etc - but upping the hysteria with
unfounded accusations of the possible effects of given virii (I'm not sure
which plural I prefer) isn't going to help any.  Nothing personal here Doug,
but in my experience the first time CHKDSK ever gets run on a disk is
following a (suspected) viral/trojan attack.  I've often seen people complain
about the sort of things you mention above after running CHKDSK (or whatver)
for the first time (after having the machine for months/years), and then
promptly blame the last "unusual" or "suspicious" thing they remember
occurring as the culprit - "That new game", where all that happened was that
someone did a DIR on the floppy and got a "General failure error" message etc.

Much better that PC-users are well-informed about the different viruses out
there and that they be made aware of the likelihood and means of infection.
The more they know about the operating system and how to use some of the basic
diagnostics (CHKDSK, etc) the better but, realistically, it isn't very likely
that people will bother with the latter - they see the PC as a tool to help
them in their work, and don't much care about its workings (so long as it works
as they imagine it should).  PC-users *ARE* talking about virii so we should
do our utmost to ensure they are not misinformed.

Have you actually seen these symptoms and were they conclusively due to
STONED??  Has anyone else seen something similar that can clearly be
attributed to STONED?

Answers to these questions welcome (maybe mail is more appropriate) -
discussion of other points/issues to the group.

I'm not saying STONED is a *safe* virus (perish the thought), but it *IS*
much less of a threat/nuisance than many others.

Subject: Re: Dark Avenger frequency (PC)

Although Dark Avenger is not a virus that can be frequently seen in the U.S., I
can tell you that it is often found in pirateware in Greece. As a SysOp of one
of the major BBS's in Athens, I have seen it in at least three different
uploaded files (by different people of course, none of who knew they had it).

It was also found in pre-formatted and pre-loaded hard disks that a computer
store in Athens sold with their computers, before they realized that they had a
virus in their computer.

Subject: Boot sector virus on SVGA disk (PC)

I also encountered the boot sector virus on the SVGA disk by
accidentally booting the disk on a 286 clone.  It played notes, a
tune, and then shut up.  Later that day the boot sector was corrupted
enough to disallow booting form the hard drive.  I booted from a
floppy, did a complete backup, and then did a low-level format of the
hard drive, and reloaded my software.  Things have been OK since,
until today I get no response at all when I turn the machine on.  I
suspect a hardware problem, perhaps a dead CMOS battery, but it is
astrange coincidence nonetheless.  The fact the virus is a new one led
me to think it was a hardware problem from the beginning.

Subject: Norton Disc Doctor in UK (PC)

When running Norton Disc Doctor (from v5.0), I came across a very
strange error message. Norton claimed to have "received" a message
from the boot sector that went...

	Your disk is knackered!

	HA HA!!

This was displayed in a standard red Norton error/message box during
the boot sector check of NDD. I immediately thought this was a virus,
but am not so sure now. One of our machines (not the one I run Norton
on) in the office has been trashing disks by (what looks like)
overwriting alternate bytes in the FAT and elsewhere. It was these
disks that were giving the "error" (probably a faulty disk controller
but not confirmed yet as it's a loan machine from a manufacturer).
Also, I remembered that I had only partially installed Norton on my
own machine and once re-installed, Norton gave no such errors.

I have checked everything for viruses with Bates & Solomons & F-PROT
etc. but nothing comes up and none of my files or system sectors are
changing. So, it looks like I have discovered a hidden message in
Norton that is distinctly unfriendly. My guess is that it's a protection
device or some obsolete piece of code I have triggered by accident. All
the same, it doesn't say much for Norton if that is the case.

I would have called Norton but there is no UK number and I am not
allowed to dial to America from my office! Have there been any other
occurrences of the "knackered" message or is there still the possibility
of a new virus on my computer?

Subject: Assorted Viruses, anti-viruses, programming

I am interested in learning what the different types of viruses there
are.  Some of their symptoms, techniques of infiltration, etc.  I've
read this list for a while (and even posted something about the Whale
Virus), and want to learn as much about these viruses as possible.
Forwarned is forarmed...

Also, I know that many people who are virus-makers do so for malicious
delite, for the most part.  Just to be immortalized, I guess, or maybe
they are sadistic?  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone knows of anti-
viruses created by other semi-malicious people who create them just to
irrate the virus-makers.  I don't mean manufacturers who create the
disinfect programs, I mean someone who makes a program that is spread
like a virus, reproduces itself, and only destroys viruses.

Someone mentioned how the Stealth viruses will remove their presence from
a piece of programming being used/scanned.  If this is so, how are they
dangerous?  If everytime it is used, it just goes elsewhere, what harm
does it do, except for accidental erasure of segments of a program?
Although I guess that the extra memory would tend to waste disk space...

What kind of field is out there for anti-virus programmers?  Who would
hire them, and how much computer knowledge would be needed?
Come to think of it, what languages are most used to create viruses and
the disinfectant programs?  Just wondering.

yes and no.  As I remember, there was a PKZIP1.2 (or was it 1.1) that

Are you SURE?  I would disagree... the lab in our building has Stoned
infections occurring very frequently, and not all of them are due to
people booting from infected disks.  If that WERE the case, how would
it spread to a floppy from hard drive?

Yes, and can be triggered by several actions. It is not common though. We
just had a badly confused machine report the WHALE. Since a check of memory
came up clean and the flagged files had not grown after a cold boot, our
tech was able find a bad RAM chip that was causing the erratic operation.
PPROPER TRAINING OF TECHNICAL PEOPLE IS ESSENTIAL (i know, it's not polite to

This is an old "joke" file and is harmless by itself. Being a .COM file it
is easily infected and this may be where two of the infections came from. The
STONED is a boot sector infector and can (officially) only be contracted by
booting with an infected floppy in drive A. My guess is that someone
deliberately infected your machine since three-on-a-disk is odd to say the
least.

As usual, Otto has made excellent points & I would recommend re-reading his
posting. Why are there no/few mainframe viruses ? - Worms are easier to write.
Of course sometimes the viral writers go to absurd lengths to try to hide their
wares while leaving their backsides open to the winds. "Stealth" viruses are
a case in point: 4096, Flip, Whale, Joshi as well as Brain, Stoned,
Yale/Alameda all move the TOM making detection trivial, but few seem to bother
to look. (Ignorance is curable, though).

Part of the problem is that the virus writer just needs to come across an
interesting point in "The DOS Programmer's Reference" to come up with
something new, while we have to be aware of all the "holes" and undocumented
features in the O/S and below to be able to respond. The hardest thing in the
world to determine is what something is not.

The destruction I have had to correct from such viruses rarely stems from the
code itself, rather it is the mistakes in the code that cause the real trouble.
Fortunately, there seems to be little in the way of originality in malicious
software, however, since it is matched by an equal lack of observation by
most users (some time ago I came across a nice little trojan that had been
unnoticed by the people who had it on their PCs. It was 270k long and had been
written in Clipper) such irritants are widespread.

What makes it hard to sleep sometimes is not the viruses I know, but those
that I can imagine.
