Subject: Removing Joshi virus (PC)

I would like to thank the members of the Virus-L, Fidonet and Interlink virus
conferences for there feedback on this program. Earlier, I posted a remover
for the Joshi Virus that didn't check for the virus before trying to remove
it. I have now added several checks to the new version of the program....

This program will remove the Joshi virus from the hard disk. McAfee's
SCANV64 or above will detect it. The virus can also be detected by
looking at the partition table with a HEX editor such as Norton
Utilities. First, cold boot (turn the machine off) off a clean, write
protected diskette. Then look at the partition record (Track 0, Head
0, Sector 1). If the first two bytes are Hex EB 1F, the hard disk is
infected.

The virus also does some other things to make itself detectable. When
the date is set to 1-05-(any year), a green screen with the words
"TYPE HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOSHI" appear on the screen. The machine will
halt until the message is typed.

Also, CHKDSK will show 6k less memory than is available on an
unifected system .

Probably the most annoying bug in the virus is that it won't allow you
to format a diskette while it is active in memory; the system will
give a "bad track 0" error.

To use, first boot off an unifected diskette (this is very important).
Then type RMJOSHI. This will remove the virus from the hard disk. It
will leave traces of the virus in the partition table but the virus
will be disabled and the system will be returned to normal.

 RMJOSHI will give four messages:

 Joshi Removed   - The virus was found and removed from the partition table
                   of the hard disk.
 Joshi not found - Either the virus is active in memory or the hard disk is not
                   infected.
 Joshi can not   - Either the partition record is corrupted or you have a new
 be removed        variation of the virus.

 Read Error      - The program aborted because there was an error reading the
                   hard disk.
 Write Error     - The program aborted because there was an error writing to
                   the hard disk.

When dealing with viruses, there is always a danger of losing
programs or data.  Thus, I offer no warranty on these programs. They
may be freely distributed as long as they are not altered in any way.
I can be reached on the FIDONET virus echo, the INTERLINK virus echo
and VIRUS-L digest. I can also be reached on BITNET as
MMCCUNE@SCT.NVE. It is free to use by all private individuals
(Institutions please contact me first).

Subject: ABS Virus (PC)

Any body can send me any information to remove a virus called ( ABS
VIRUS ) infected one of our IBM PCs in KFU.This virus seems to be a
version of (C) Brain since it gives its name to the hard disk volume.
We tried to remove it using Macafee 67 virus ,but it does not recogize
it.  Thanks a lot ,,,

Unfortunately, we have. The Internet worm carried code for both SUN
and VAX ULTRIX machines, detected the architecture of the target
machine, and propagated accordingly. Similarly, I have an MS-DOS
trojan that supposidly (I have not yet checked it out) detects a
Windows environment and makes sure it is run on boot-up. Consequently,
it does not have to infect anything else. Like many boot and partition
sector infectors that are more worm than virus, it is targetted at a
specific environment, however the potential for a MIRV is there.

Consequently, I agree with Mr. Bosen that to say that dissimilar
client/ server architectures is safety enough is folly.

Subject: Re: Signatures

DKAZEM@NAS.BITNET (Don Kazem) writes:
>I have couple of questions:
>
>Is there any way to obtain the signatures of all known viruses?

Depends on what you mean by "signature", as the term has two different
meanings..

	A: The signature the virus itself uses to mark files or boot sectors
	   as infected. Example: Jerusalem 'SuMsdos' signature at the end of
	   .COM files.

	B: The signature string used by virus scanning program to check if
	   a virus is present.

Now if you mean (A), the answer is yes, apart from the fact that
several viruses, ('405' for example) do not check if files are
infected, and therefore they have no signature.  If (B), the answer is
also yes, except that it is not possible to provide any string at all
for some of the latest viruses.  The Phoenix fanily (Phoenix, Proud,
1226 and Evil) from Bulgaria is one example, the Whale is another.

In either case, no 100% complete lists are available, simply because
no virus researcher has a copy of all known or reported viruses. Even
the best virus collections only contain 250-270 variants.

>What is the correct definition of an encrypted virus?

Encrypted viruses - my favourite subject at the monemt (I just wrote a
4-page article about them for the Virus Bulletin) - are a bit hard to
define.

We have viruses, like 'Brain', where only a single text string or so
is encrypted.

We have the following viruses, where the first part of the virus code
performs a decryption of the rest:

	Pretoria:      simple XOR operation wit a fixed value
	July 13th:     simple XOR with a fixed value
	Slow:          simple XOR with a fixed value
	Cascade:       complex XOR
	Datacrime II:  complex XOR - slightly self-modifying
	800:           simple XOR
	Syslock/Macho: complex XOR
	1260/Casper:   complex XOR, self-modifying
	Suomi:	       simple XOR, self-modifying
	Phoenix family:simple XOR, self-modifying

In addition to the above viruses, Mark Washburn, the author of '1260'
(according to the list by Patricia Hoffman), has also written some
other encrypted 'research' viruses: V2P2, V2P6 and V2P6Z.

And finally we have the Whale, where most of the code is devoted to
implementing multiple layers of encryption. [And the rest is devoted
to driving virus-researchers insane.... :-( ]

Without doubt a formal definition could be written, to cover the
encrypted viruses, but I'll leave that to somebody else...

Not hype, John.  There are a limited number of hours in the day and in
a life.  I'm pretty sure that the virus writers of the world think
they're having a wonderful time.  But, as I hate anyone who wastes my
time, I've also taken a strong dislike to anyone who wastes another's
time.  The computing field is no longer as open as it once was.  A
field that I love working in no longer is a "trustworthy" one.

So, yes, I still have nothing but hostile feelings to the virus
writers of the world.  I might rewrite my documentation one day so it
does not appear to come from such a crazy man...but the feelings are
still there.

Additionally, Pam Kane's book is an interesting chronicle of the beginning
of the whole anti virus industry.  Good reading.  And, on top of all that,
Pam's a lovely lady, too!

Aside from the Panda Utility you mention, Ray Glath has a decent
little scanner, called VISpy.  Very nice product.  My own entry into
the scanner olympics is a totally commercial package, Virex-PC.  There
is, however, a demo of the product (sans disinfectors) called
"SCANDEMO" on most BBS systems and "SCANVX" over on Compuserve.  It's
a fast little puppy and, even though a demo package that will fill
your screen with reminders that you should buy the full package, it's
still a damned fine scanner -- even if I say so myself.

You can get a copy of it, also, in the new release of FLU_SHOT+,
Version 1.81, released just a few days ago.  Version 1.8 had a pretty
silly bug in it that V1.81 kills.

Subject: Virus, NetWare & law suits

Back in June I received what purported to be a "Novell virus." I
contacted Greg Drusdow, president of NUI (NetWare Users
International), and he arranged with Novell to provide test facilities
at their Paramus, NJ offices.  Testing was done by myself and Jay
Nickson (creater of Quarantine, an anti-virus product for Novell
LANs), with Greg as an advisor/observer.

Our tests showed the virus bypassing server write protection
(read-only status has not proven to be too effective against most
viruses), but further enabling nodes to write to the server without
the write privilege.  (This last was viewed as bypassing Novell
security, a potentially more critical event that the viral
activities.)

Jay, Greg and I met at Novell at around 8:30 on the morning of July
11th.  We conclusively demonstrated the above, first to ourselves,
then to designated Novell representatives, and made a full verbal
report to Provo by 5:30 in the afternoon.  All three of us were there
on our own time, no monies requested, none offered.  NUI had the
results of our tests put out on NetWire the next day, and I sent an
appropriate note to Ken van Wyk (which was on VALERT-L on the 12th,
and reprinted in next VIRUS-L).

Based on either or both the NetWire and/or VALERT-L/VIRUS-L notices, I
got some calls from media reps.  I (and the others) repeated what
happened, and one story (in Network World) got printed on the subject.
(A second story, this one in LAN Magazine, dealt with LAN security and
also mentioned virus issue.)

The three of us gave of our time and energies to try to be of help to
NetWare users, to test things out before crying wolf (or virus).  To
say that Novell was less than enthusiastic about our efforts is an
understatement.

(It is important to note at this time that the three of us stayed at
Novell until 11:30PM that first evening, and that Jay and I billed for
our time then spent to run tests at Novell's request; further, I spent
a year in Provo one day around the end of August, and I billed for my
time.  Nothing new regarding the virus behavior arose during either of
these two periods.)

I have received a note from the Novell Corporate Counsel.  Seems that
they've read some stuff they don't care for, stuff with my name (as a
source, not author).  Using phrases such as breach of contract and
false and defamatory statements, it seems that, if I don't shut up,
they're going to sue my butt off.

In order to protect myself I am assembling as comprehensive a
collection of Novell security problems - both virus and all other - as
possible.  (I do, of course, prefer virus problems, but
about-to-be-sued beggers can't be chosers.)  All potentially damaging
[to Novell] reports will be verified, and once an appropriately nasty
set of stuff (that can be reporduced at will) is assembled, I will
pass it on to a highly respected security/virus expert for release to
the public.

I urge any of you with knowledge of Novell security and/or virus
problems to get information thereof to me ASAP.  E-mail is, of course,
the quickest way, but, if you have trouble sending, want to remain
anonymous, or for some other reason[s] do not want to e-contact me, my
address is

    63 Hamilton Avenue
    Tappan, NY 10983-1002 (USA)

and my phone number (say hello to my answering computer if I'm not
there) is

    (914)359-5566.

Please make your information as detailed as possible - hardware,
IPX/shell versions, node OS, NetWare version, sequence of events, etc.
(Remember, I have to be able to reporduce what you report.)

Subject: Bitnet Worm spotted... (IBM VM/CMS)

For the joy and edification of those who track such things, I'd like to
report that a verified worm has been spotted on Bitnet.

Known Salient Points:

The filename/filetype is "TERM MODULE".  In the spool area, it is 42 records
long.  On a minidisk, it is 3 records, recfm V, lrecl 2904.  The datestamp
on the copy I received for analysis is 10/08/90 05:57

The program started as a Rexx exec to "pretty-print" the CP QUERY NAMES
command with nicknames, etc.

Some (as yet unidentified) clown then added code to do the following:
(a) it sends a copy of itself to everybody in your NAMES file
(b) It sends a copy of 'ALL NOTEBOOK' to yourself (kind of pointless..)

It was then fed into a program to convert it to MODULE format.
The MODULE is apparently just a "front end" to the Rexx interpreter -
there is no readily visible "dangerous" code. I will be completing a
disassembly of the module header shortly, but do not expect any suprises.
If I find any, I will post a followup...

Due to stylistic differences, I am convinced that the programmers for
parts (1) and (2/3) are different people.

The date on the MODULE is 10/08/90, and there haven't been many sightings
that I know of.  Apparently, it hasn't reached "critical mass" on the
network yet.
