one of the lists in mark smith's list of security-related interest
groups [virus-l issue #202] is no longer at the same location.
score.stanford.edu was deactivated more than a year ago.  the tops-20
list has moved to
   TOPS-20@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
i am not certain what address is now used to subscribe.  however,
traffic is now very sparse as the number of tops-20 systems still in
active service is rapidly dwindling, and new information on security
issues is unlikely.

         FEARS OF COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACK FROM EASTERN EUROPE GROW.
  From: The Independent, Sat 24.11.90, By Susan Watts, Science reporter.

The computer industry in Britain is being warned against an influx of
malicious viruses from eastern Europe.

Governments and companies there use computers less widely than those
in the West. The range of applications is limited and so programmers
have time to write these destructive programs.

Bryan Clough, a computer consultant based in Hove, East Sussex,
returned last week from Bulgaria with 100 viruses unknown in the West.

"People have been writing these as a form of protest against the
authorities.  Some are very good indeed...I am terrified of running
them on my machine but until I do I will have no idea of what they are
capable of", he says.  Mr Clough predicts a wave of virus attacks on
Britain, launched mainly through electronic message systems known as
Bulletin boards. One bulletin board in Birmingham already believes it
has been hit by Bulgarian viruses.  These programs can corrupt or
destroy data stored on a computer's hard disk.  Jim Bates, who
dismantles viruses for Scotland Yard's Computer Crime Unit,says "I'm
having a hell of a job keeping up with the viruses coming through
already.  The problem is that we can only screen for viruses that we
know about".

He warns the computer industry against rogue software from eastern
Europe, Bulgaria and Russia are thought to harbour the most virulent
viruses.  The small but legitimate software industry in Bulgaria
complains that programming is one of the few skills that the industry
can exploit. Recent concern is killing off even this slim chance of
gaining hard currency from overseas.

Part of the problem is that the authorities do not believe in
copyright or patent protection for software. "Programmers are used to
ripping off software" Mr Clough says, "so that they are expert at
hacking into each others systems and planting viruses."

He found at least 30 people producing viruses in Bulgaria. Most are
known to the police who can do little to stop them since the country
has no laws against computer crime. Even in Britain which introduced
legislation against hacking this summer, virus writers can be arrested
only if they enter a computer system without authority or cause damage
once inside.

Scotland Yard's anti-virus team can extradite foreign programmers who
flout this law, if Britain has an extradition treaty with the country
concerned.  One of the most worrying of the virus-writers calls
himself the "Dark Avenger".  He has written a number of malicious
programs, and Mr Clough believes he intends to plant these in Britain
shortly. Virus detectives are dismantling one such program called
"Nomenklatura", thought to have been written by this man.

Security experts in Britain fear programmers in the Soviet Union may
soon follow Bulgaria's lead. The Soviet Union has no copyright laws,
and some sections of the software industry are already using viruses
as a way to punish those who steal programs. One such virus displays
the message "Lovechild in "Lovechild:in reward for stealing software"
on the screen.

Less than two years ago there were only 20 or so virus programs
around, now there are hundreds. In Bulgaria a new virus appears once a
week, Mr Clough says.

To paraphrase this JUST a little bit..

There are many different types of machines running different types of
MS-DOS.  For this reason it is very unlikely that a MS-DOS virus could
ever become as widespread as the Morris Worm, for example.  As soon as
it arrived at a machine with a different floppy controller (or even
the same machine with a different version of the BIOS) its propagation
at that point would be blocked.

How many "malicious" viruses have we seen?  And how many "innocuous"
ones have there been that hurt people because they didn't know about
MS-DOS 3.1, or MS-DOS 4.0, or this manufacturer's funky BIOS rom
or....

But it didn't stop the virus from spreading enough to be a problem, did it?

If anything, a Unix virus would be EASIER to write - because (for
example) the semantics of 'seek()' or 'open()' have not been
drastically changed since 1974 or so.  I have currently going a
project that is literally 250,000 lines of code, and is known to work
on Apollo, bsd4.2, bsd4.3, bsd4.4, hpux, solbourne,sunos 3, sunos 4,
sys5.2, ultrix 3.1, ultrix 4.0 (for both Vax and Mips CPUs).

Now, since a virus *IS* just another program, it should be fairly
simple for a competent programmer to write a measly 300 lines of code
that will run on at least as many systems as the aformentioned
monster....  Of course, it helps that the semantics of 'open()' have
not drastically changed since 1974, as opposed to MS-DOS, that likes
to keep changing the register contents of the various INT calls every
release or two....

  There are some public domain one-way checksum generators available
in source form.  If there is sufficient interest, I'd be willing to
write a shareware program to further compare the checksum against an
encrypted correct checksum, which is distributed along with the virus
scanner.
  Please send me a one-line message if you'd like to have such a
shareware public key signature system, and suggest a price you'd
consider reasonable.  Please don't send me longer e-mail messages
unless you are directly involved in virus fighting or public key
signature systems yourself.  I'll post more details within a couple of
weeks, if there is interest.

This may be true of the Jerusalem family, but I understand that there
are virii that (attempt to) intercept Ctrl/Alt/Del so they are not
removed by a "warm boot".  It would be possible to write a crude boot
simulation (which would easily fool most users) but would leave the
viral code "active".

I would recommend that you turn off then restart a PC left by another
user, or if you have the option press the hardware Reset switch (on HD
machines this has obvious advantages).  (Some students here revel in
writing DOS command line simulator progs that they leave running when
they leave a terminal.  An unsuspecting user comes along, logs in,
enters password, the program writes both to a file, and then when the
new user tries to execute a command the prog will return some
plausible sounding error message suggesting that a re-boot is needed.
The user obliges and the author of the prog has another usercode and
password to add to their list.)

Sorry to interrupt you comp.virus people with a software request ... but ...

If someone could tell me where I can grab some virus protection exes
from, I'd be grateful! Unfortunately, I'm limited to what comes from
mail-servers, so they're preferred to ftp sites (which aren't
impossible, just impractical)

I'd also like some advice as to which programs to get. So far, I
haven't been hit by a virus of any kind, and I'm reasonably sure that
I could recover from one if it did get onto my systems, but I need to
be able to support other people who ask me for stuff. As internal
software releases pass through my machines, I don't want to get caught
out!

Any advice ? Please email me, as I don't have time to read *every*
newsgroup out there, and Twin Peaks has priority! (did *I* say that?)

     I just downloaded the new v72 McAfee virus utilities from
wsmr-simtel20.army.mil, and found that while the NETSCAN program was
longer than v71, it still claims to be version 71 on startup.  Was
this just an oversight on McAfee's part in forgetting to change the
number, or could the wrong program be in the archive?  (Trojan! :) )

Subject: Viruses as Political/Military Weapon?

I want to raise a sensitive issue on Virus-L without planting ideas
(although those making viruses don't seem to need ideas from any of
us).  Yet, it is important to raise and share information of this sort
with other networkers.

I would like to gather any *hard* evidence that viruses have been used
for political/military purposes or as a war weapon.  It is possible
that the Jerusalem virus was first set off to commemorate a
Palestinian event but has there been any way to verify this?  Are
there other viruses that have been specifically distributed or
directed to harm a political/military/ideological foe?  It is
important to differentiate this type of attack from someone setting
off a virus that contains a political statement but which is not
directed against a particular target. I know that this differentiation
is soft but I am trying to develop an appropriate categorization.  Any
help on this is appreciated.

What got me thinking about this is my work on developing a model of
computer crime and abuse trends and their stages of development.  The
flap earlier this year about the availability of a small business
contract to develop a virus for the U.S. military may well be part of
a larger picture of computerized warfare joining other threats, such
as biological and chemical warfare by many nations.

Comments can be sent directly to me at MCI MAIL: SSHERIZEN (396-5782)
and I will summarize in a future Virus-L posting.

Thanks

I have seen this happen, but it seems due to a corrupted document,

that's been corrupted in some (unclear exactly how) way.

I have been able to correct this in many cases (but not all if I

- -- using Norton Utilities to save the blocks containing the file

- -- in WordPerfect by (getting rid of extraneous or confusing embedded

(I'm not sure getting rid of the extraneous codes was necessary to

Subject: Query for Basica Information on Viruses

I am rather new to this list and have been scanning the digests for
useful information.  My main motivation for joining is to get up to
speed on virus detection and prevention on PC/MS DOS machines, as we
have many located in offices and student accessible labs.  We haven't
had a serious problem with viruses as yet, but there are signs that
our charmed existence may be about over with.

We are interested in virus prevention on other platforms as well, as
we have an increasing number of Macintoshes in labs and offices, a VMS
VAX and a small net of Sun workstations.  However on those machines
we've either already addressed the problems or it doesn't represent as
serious a threat to our operations.

My question is, can anyone recommend some good basic information to
start with such as a magazine article, book or archive message that
explains the fundamentals of virus detection and prevention for the
PC/MS DOS world.  I would like to know (only in general terms) a bit
more about how there are created and propagated, the various types and
the dangers they present and best method of dealing with them.

I would also like recommendations on anti-virus software for MS-DOS
systems.  What are the top two or three virus detection/prevention
programs, shareware or commercial?

A response to this query would be appreciated and I'm sure would help
any other readers in the same boat.

I recently asked the net for pointers to software running under xenix
that would detect virus in DOS software. A decision has yet to be made
about which solution to go with, but thanks to those who responded.
Here is a summary of the responses received:

- -  davidsen@crdos1.crd.ge.COM (Wm E Davidsen Jr) suggests an approach
involving VP/ix and a good virus detector, such as those from McAfee
and frisk.

- -  MINSKEEP@PENNSAS.UPENN.EDU (Michael Inskeep) suggests contacting
McAfee Associates, 4423 Cheeney Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054 for
information. I suppose this would involve contracting with them to
port their software.

- - warren@worlds.com (Warren Burstein) writes about a set of anti-virus
programs called VACCINE produced by his company (WorldWide Software)
and says that it would not be difficult to come out with a Xenix or
Unix version of that part of the package which scans for viruses. He
also provides a list of the viruses which VACCINE will detect and says
free updates are available to customers from WorldWide Software's bbs
system. [BTW: If you're interested in a unix/xenix port of WorldWide
Software's product, Warren says you should contact him directly.]

Subject: re:University Policy

I just got around to reading an older issue of VIRUS-L (I have trouble
keeping up).  I saw a response to what apparently was a question from
you concerning policies on virus protection.  Here at Oakland
Community College we were hit with a widespread infection of the Joshi
virus last summer.  This was specifically in the IBM world.  The
policy we developed was (basically):

   1.  Each student is responsible for keeping his own diskettes clean.  The
       college is responsible for keeping our hard drives clean (We are not
       networked yet.)
   2.  To that end, we have a site license of Vi-Spy from RG Software Systems.
       ($15 per computer).  We use this to protect our hard drive and students
       may USE it to check their diskettes.
   3.  We provide a copy of the registration document for McAfee's software
       products so students may license the less expensive products for use
       on their own computers.

In addition, we made a short video that all instructors could show to
their students explaining this policy.  This seems too simple to be
effective.  Does it work?  I'll let you know after the Winter
semester.
