VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

As I understand it, the PIN (Personal Identification Number) is not
stored on the ATM card, but is retrieved by the ATM and compared with
the number entered on the ATM keypad.  The ATM machines are on a wide
area network, and I don't know if the PIN is actually transmitted, or
if the result of some algorithm applied to PIN is sent (the latter, I
hope!).  Also, the PIN is four digits (or at least mine is).

VIRUS ALERT!!  Here's a message from Steve Palincsar at the GAO about a
verified virus in a depository library shipment.  Please note and repost this
wherever it might be read earliest...

Depository libraries have received notification from Regional Depositories
and the U.S. Goovernment Printing Office that depository shipment #900057-p,
which contains a CD ROM disk of census statistics from the census bureau and
two floppy diskettes of software to access the CD disk contains a diskette
(labeled "2 of 2") which is contaminated with the Jerusalem Virus.  Recip-
ients are urged to destroy disk "2 of 2" immediately, and are warned that
the Jerusalem Virus can destroy data on their entire system.  We were notified
by Hugh O'Connor of the Univ. of MD REgional Library; I called him and con-
firmed the authenticity of the call we'd received, and then followed up by
calling Joe McLean [spelling unconfirmed], Chief of GPO's Inspection Team
(202-275-1119) who also confirmed the authenticity of the report.  Shipment
#900057-P was mailed 1/25/90.  There were no details about how replacement
software would be supplied for the contaminated diskettes.

I phoned the folks at the GPO and confirmed that the above report is
indeed true.  They faxed me a copy of a letter which they're sending
out to the people that they know have received the disks.  Below is a
(transcribed - sorry if there are typos) copy of that fax.

===== Cut Here =====

Dear Depository Librarian:

GPO has just been notified by the Census Bureau that one of the floppy
disks just distributed by GPO with the _County and City Data Book_
CD-ROM is infected with a computer virus AND SHOULD NOT BE USED UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  The floppy disk was listed on shipping list
90-0057-P as C 3.134/2:C 83/2/988/floppy-2.  The title on the floppy
disk reads as follows:

Bureau of the Census
Elec. County & City Data Bk., 1988
U.S. Stats., Inc., 1101 King St.,
Suite 601, Alexandria, VA 22314
(703) 979-9699

PLEASE DESTROY THE FLOPPY DISK AS SOON AS IT IS RECEIVED.  (Do NOT
reformat and reuse the floppy disk.)

The virus has been identified as the Jerusalum-B virus (also referred
to as the Israeli virus).  It infects any .COM or .EXE program on
MS-DOS personal computers and increases program size by approximately
1,800 bytes.  Other programs are infected when they are executed in an
infected system.

The Jerusalum virus can cause significant damage on an infected
personal computer.  It generally slows down the system and some
versions destroy all data on the hard disk.  .EXE files continue to
grow in size until they are too large to execute.

If your computer has already been infected, we recommend that, if
possible, you seek assistance from a computer specialist at your
institution immediately.  There are special programs available for
detecting and eradicating computer viruses.  One may be available in
your institution or from someone you know.  DO NOT USE YOUR PC TO
ACCESS A NETWORK OR PRODUCE FLOPPY DISKS CONTAINING .EXE OR .COM
PROGRAMS FOR BY OTHER PCS.

The _County and City Data Book_ CD-ROM can be used safely with the
software on the other floppy disk disk distributed in that shipment
((C 134/2:C 83/2/988/floppy).

If you have any questions, please call Jan Erickson at GPO (202
275-1003) or the Census Bureau Customer Service at (301 763-4100).

The Census Bureau and GPO regret any problems that this may have
caused.  Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that it does not
happen again.

The issue here is whether it was appropriate to say that Mr. Morris
had released the worm prior to a finding of that fact in a court of
law.  IMHO it is not, and that we should say that this act is alleged,
until the court decides otherwise (which it recently did).

According to what you read in the papers, Mr. Morris's lawyers
conceded that he conducted the act of releasing the worm.  However,
this does not constitute a finding of fact, as you maintain.  I can
think of a half dozen instances where a confession to an act would be
rejected by a court of law after a weighting of ALL the evidence.  A
confession is merely evidence in a trial, and although it obviously
carries a great deal of weight, it does not, in and of itself,
constitute a finding of fact.

It was interesting to note how you structured your response to my
concern.  You listed the reasons why you felt that Mr. Morris's
releasing the worm was a "finding of fact", and not alleged.  In
effect, you conducted your own little mini-trial; using such evidence
as something you read in the New York Times.  Are you claiming that
you have heard ALL the evidence presented in this trial?  Are you
claiming to have been declared by both the prosecution and the defense
to be acceptable to sit in judgment in this case?  Do you have the
benefit of eleven other jurors to confer with and have agree with you
in your personal "finding of facts"?  No.  That is why we have courts
of law to find fact after weighting ALL the evidence as part of an
orderly process that protects all concerned (at least in theory).  I
do not want to assign this authority to the New York Times, nor the
Judicial Boards at Cornell, nor to your or my own personal evaluation
based on partial evidence.  Until the time that the court completed
its job and ruled on facts and guilt, I felt it was appropriate to
label the charges against Mr. Morris as alleged.

Subject: Public PC lab responsibility

What is a public lab responsibility to end users in regard to viruses?
The answer is that you do the best you can.

Our office Mac is available to the public for (emergency) laser
printing, and we have adopted measures to prevent infection.  First,
the user's disk is scanned for viruses with Disinfectant.  There are
absolutely *NO* exceptions.  If a virus is found, we offer to remove
it.  If that is declined, the user may receive Disinfectant 1.5 (free,
of course), to clean up his/her system.  Either way, we will *NOT*
have anything to do with an infected disk.

Some secondary protection measures include:
(1) all commands are issued by our staff, not the end user.
(2) Our hard drive is periodically scanned for infection.
(3) Vaccine is the first init installed.

I cannot say what our legal liability is, but surely any court can see that
we are taking all reasonable precautions.  Comments?

     No, No, No, a thousand times NO!  If nothing else the discussion
in this group about the theoretical impossibility of determining
whether or not certain code is a virus should convince you that it is
certainly immpossible in practice as well as in theory whether any
source code could be intended as part of a virus.

     Also note that the Internet Worm could an did transmit and
compile source code on the machine it was infecting.  Should anyone
whose machine was infected be locked up?

     As a (part-time) system administrator, I think it is my
responsibility to track activity in this area.  If new virus threatens
any system for which I am responsible, I want to know that either I,
or someone I trust who specializes in virus detection and elimination,
can get a copy of the virus from someone who has been hit and
disassemble it.  It would be silly to say that I can be infected
(tough luck, sorry about that) but if I try to disassemble the virus I
am breaking the law.  Note that there are several "non-boot block"
viruses which imbed themselves in other programs.  The easiest way to
find them (before a special tool is developed for the particular
virus) is to use a disassembler.

   I think that sending something to this list is probably sufficient
notice to all of the existing watchdog groups.  I'll let Gene Spafford
answer whether the group set up in response to the Internet Worm is
interested in tracking such requests.

   I don't know.  I'm seeing this second hand, did you report it?

   Agreed.  The current state of computer networking is true anarchy.
That means that we are all resonsible for our own protection.  (I
don't consider that a bad thing, but note that in any case nodes and
subnets may have rules and organizations to enforce them.  It is just
at the highest level that anarchy exists.)

>   Can we make it illegal to have virus sources without stomping on our

   No.  Obviously there are some countries where such laws would be
constitutional.  However, like gun control any such regulations would
be futile, even if such laws could be enforced in a transnational
environment like the net.  If Robert Morris, Jr. had developed his
code (from New York State) on an computer in Canada, and relased it
into a European network, I think that he still might have violated the
(US) federal computer abuse statues, but where would he have violated
your proposed law against owning virus sources?

Subject: Anti-virus suite

Please excuse if this is regularly published information....

Which among the many commercial and PD anti-virus programs would you
recommend as part of a cost-almost-no-object suite of programs to
protect an MSDos and OS/2 software development department against a
virus appearing on the development machines, or, infinitely worse, on
the product disk?

Does anyone offer a continuing anti-viral update service?

If you had to *guarantee* that no such product disks contained a
virus, how would you go about it, other than taking measures to
maintain an anti-infection clean-machine environment?

Thanks.  I'll summarize email replies back to this group.

   True, only if you're looking for a known pattern.  Otherwise, you're
   guessing that your algorithm is smarter than the bad guys.  Not on my
   machine you don't!  You're gonna have to scan the whole file, every
   byte to tell me if there has been a change...[Lots more deleted.]

   What Bob Bosen is proposing is an algorithm which does scan the
whole file, and does notice if any byte has been changed.  His point
is that most of this checking can be done with simple CRC techniques
and only a small part of the file needs to be encrypted with a
sophisticated algorithm.  There exist such techniques, and if they are
correctly implemented the effort to change the program in a way hich
does not change the "final" CRC, or to calculate a new CRC result, is
at least as difficult as solving the sophisticated algorithm.

   Even in your "hypothetical" PC/XT case,the computer can perform
several instructions per each byte read from a hard disk.  It is
possible (and on my Amiga, I do exactly this) to use a packing
program, and a loader which automatically unpacks the executable code,
and have the packed code load quicker (from a fast hard disk even!)
than the actual program.  Saves on disk space too.  A packing program
which encoded source with my personal "signature" could produce pakced
programs which loaded faster (including the verification) than the
original program.  And if done "right" the encryption key needed to
create a loadable program could not be deduced from the loader.
(Unless P=NP :-)
