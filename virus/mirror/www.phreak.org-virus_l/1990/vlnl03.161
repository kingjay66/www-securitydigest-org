VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

    I'd like to report that the "Stoned" virus infection in our lab
was successfully removed using Mc Afee's SCAN & CLEAN software.
Thanks to JIM SCHENCK, from Florida International University, who sent
me a compilation of all "Stoned" related information that appeared in
past issues of VIRUS-L.  Maybe an additional service in the list could
maintain separate files containing specific information about each
virus.  I don't know if someone can manage to do the additional work
needed, but i think that this effort would be of great value.  I leave
it as a suggestion ...

Subject: Accucard (PC)

Some months ago, (Virus-L Vol. 2 No. 259) I mentioned a new problem to
beware of when disinfecting a machine that was designed to save the
machine state in CMOS RAM or to the disk.  This is even more important
with stealth viruses becoming common. The 4096 and others, if active
in memory, will infect 200 executable files in a couple minutes while
scanning for infection, or when verifying checksums.

Specifically, I mentioned a new hardware IBM-PC card from Emerson
called Accucard, which will do a graceful shutdown if power is
interrupted.  At that time, their distributor could not expain how to
defeat the card when the computer was rebooted.

They have since said this is not a problem with their card, as long as
normal good cold boot practices are followed (from a known-clean
floppy boot disk).  Although the Accucard is plugged into the bus, it
functions only with Accusaver software, which is called from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  As long as the floppy boot disk does not call it,
there should be no difference from booting any other machine.

Sierra On Line, the producers of Leisure Suit Larry, have been warning
people for a while now that there are pirated copies of LSL floating
around which are infected with a virus.  A banking firm in England had
a copy of the infected game on their system, and one day it wiped out
their entire database (I kid you not).  Moral of the story is:

(a) don't play games on corporate computers

(b) don't screw around with pirated copies of certain software.

Subject: Help, I may have a virus. (PC)

I am told that I have a virus and need some information.  This
newsgroup seems the place to ask my questions.  This is my first time
posting to the net, so any comments will be appreciated.  I don't
usually read this group, but now I have a good reason.  Any responses
may go direct to me or can be posted.

I have had trouble with my C-MOS failing during boot up and having to
fix missing or wrong information.  No big deal, but I ran the machine
back to where I bought it over the summer (and after loading several
new programs from different trusted sources).  They told me that it
was a boot sector virus.  Okay.  However, some EE and programing
friends were not so sure.  They have also checked programs I have
shared with them, without finding a virus.

Symptoms: Only seems to blow the C-MOS.  This may have been triggered
on dates with a 14 in the string, especially 2/14/90.

Does this sound like a known (or unknown) virus?  Further, (this
should provoke some discussion) what is a good book/article on viri
(?), especially for someone short on time.  And which of the many
anti-virus programs are recommended?  I don't have time to become an
expert on viruses, but should know something.

Many thanks in Advance.....

Subject: XEMAG.SYS (PC)

I have discovered something odd on my hard disk:
a file named XEMAG.SYS.  Its Archive, Read-only, Hidden, and System bits are
all set.  _I_ certainly didn't put it there - has anyone ever heard of this
file and how it comes about?
It is dated 12-30-89, 1:59p with a size of 0.

TIA.  Please respond directly as I do not subscribe.     Pen

Subject: Difficulty with F-Prot package (PC)

My initial attempts to install the F-Prot virus
protection package has met with several difficulties.
1. Once the "device=c:f-driver.sys"
   is added to config.sys on a Data Storage 386 SX
   the system will not boot.
2. The F-oschk program when run with all 5 parameters
   to check the boot sector as well as the partition
   boot record causes repeated problems, because
   the boot sector changes with each boot on the the
   systems I have tried it on thus far.
It seems that without these two modules working for
us will would not be adequately protected against
boot sector/partition boot record virii.

Anybody can help to remove a virus called ( ABC VIRUS ) which I think
is a version of (C) brain since the hard disk volume got the name of
the virus.

 Thanks ,,,

Subject: Is this a VIRUS? (PC)

Hi there,

A friend of mine has aquired an arcade game for his son, what caught
my eyes are the following:

- - when the game starts it displays the message :
    You've got ..K RAM more than ypu need Dude!
- - when I tried to reboot the system( warm boot), it displays the message:
    THAT'S ALL DUDES!
  This message stays on the screen antill another warm boot is performed.
_  XRAY didn't detect any strange activities, and the available anti-virus
  software didn't detect anything.

There is no way to tell if the files sizes are changing, because the disk
is full.

Are these symptoms of a virus (DENZUK variant for instance), or is it
a bad joke from someone who manage to change all the messages on the
disk.

Any help will be appreciated.

Regards,

O. FADEL

This is true, but viruses don't mutate often enough to matter over the
course of the expected life time of the currently used personal
computers.

Viruses make clones of themselves and (I hear) sometimes have code to
PREVENT themselves from mutating (hamming function).

Hello!

Can anyone give me more information on the Yankee Doodle Dandy virus??
I have a problem with it on my Compaq 386S at work and my PC XT clone
at home.  Is there any real danger from the program?  What effective
programs can I use (preferably shareware) to get rid of it??

Any advice in this area would be greatly appreciated!
