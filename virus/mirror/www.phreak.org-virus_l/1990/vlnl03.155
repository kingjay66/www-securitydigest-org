VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I am afraid you need to do a little more research on this.  The
government policy pushing the live-virus vaccine (Sabin) in favor of
the killed- virus vaccine emphasizes the ability of the live-virus
vaccine to spread to non-vaccinated children, spreading the benefits.
There have been several popular accounts of this as well, including
one episode on Nova (PBS).

If you wish to discuss this further. let us move it to email or
sci.medicine.

Subject: Removing Joshi (PC)

Here is a program that will detect and remove the Joshi Virus from
hard disks. It is free to use by all private individuals and any
institution that I give permission to use it. I wrote it for the
shareware A86, but it should assemble with MASM, TASM or WASM
with minor modifications.

This program will remove the Joshi virus from the hard disk. McAfee's
SCANV64 or above will detect it. The virus can also be detected by
looking at the partition table with a HEX editor such as Norton
Utilities. First, cold boot (turn the machine off) off a clean, write
protected diskette. Then look at the partition record (Track 0, Head
0, Sector 1). If the first two bytes are Hex EB 1F, the hard disk is
infected.

The virus also does some other things to make itself detectable. When
the date is set to 1-05-(any year), a green screen with the words
"TYPE HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOSHI" appear on the screen. The machine will
halt until the message is typed.

Also, CHKDSK will show 6k less memory than is available on an
unifected system.

Probably the most annoying bug in the virus is that it won't allow you
to format a diskette while it is active in memory; the system will
give a "bad track 0" error.

To use, first boot off an unifected diskette (this is very important).
Then type RMJOSHI. This will remove the virus from the hard disk. It
will leave traces of the virus in the partition table but the virus
will be disabled and the system will be returned to normal. On some
systems, RMJOSHI may damage the partition table. The program
RETURN.COM will restore the hard disk to it's origonal state. Do not
use RETURN unless you have used RMJOSHI on the hard disk at least one
time.

RMJOSHI will give four messages:

Joshi Removed   - The virus was found and removed from the partition table
                  of the hard disk.
Joshi not found - Either the virus is active in memory or the hard disk is not
                  infected.
Read Error      - The program aborted because there was an error reading the
                  hard disk.
Write Error     - The program aborted because there was an error writing to
                  the hard disk.

When dealing with viruses, there is always a danger of losing programs
or data.  Thus, I offer no warranty on these programs. They may be
freely distributed as long as they are not altered in any way. I can
be reached on the FIDONET virus echo, the INTERLINK virus echo and
VIRUS-L digest. I can also be reached on BITNET as MMCCUNE@SCT.NVE.

If you are still losing your voice explaining to normal people how to
get rid of and avoid viruses on their Macs, perhaps my newly updated
"Guide to Fighting Macintosh Viruses; Instructions for the Rest of Us"
will help. As with the previous version please feel free to steal from
it shamelessly ("Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal." - Igor
Stravinsky) to write your own document, or just use it as is.

First I include the plain, virtually unformated text followed by the
PostScript version.  In either case it is comprised of a single page

Subject: re: Mysterial message (KONIEC)

Hello amateur linguists,

my note of yesterday was a near miss or (stated euphemisticly) almost
correct. A browse through our library's dictionaries during
lunch-break revealed that the exact spelling KONIEC is used only in
the West-Slavic languages Polish and Slovac, not in Serbo-Croatian as
I had erroneously assumed. In particular, the Bulgarian word is
spelled differently and has a completely different meaning (see
below); this might be of interest to virus researchers, as we have
read of many viruses originating in Bulgaria.

Btw. the C is pronounced like a TS (definitely not like a K or G) in
all slavic languages using the Latin script; hence there is no
connection with the Germanic root KING/K
NIG, as had been conjectured
by somebody else.

I hope this will settle the discussion. Best wishes
                                                    Otto

... uh, excuse me -- I'm new to the virus group, but I do know a
little bit about 1701/hard disk errors.

The 1701 error will also come up on a disk drive that needs a
low-level format.  (I don't know if it is *possible to trash* a
low-level format with *software*.)

You should have your friend redo the low-level format on his hard
disk, although you can probably kiss the files goodbye.

On the bright side, we've had 2 XT-clones, with Seagate ST-225's that
had gone "sour" (for lack of a better term), that were revived (files
recovered and all!) by redoing the low-level format!  I won't promise
anything, but if the files aren't *critical* (i.e. worth paying $100+
for data recovery at a drive repair shop) then you ought to give it a
try.  Costs nothing.

Subject: Strange things are afoot on my Mac IIcx (Mac)

Well, I think my Mac IIcx has come down with a strange virus.
Seemingly unrelated weird goings on have cropped up in the last two
days.  Not all at once, but gradually.  I have run Disenfectant 2.1
scans on numerous occasions and turned up nothing.

The first thing that happened was that Finder Sounds just stopped
working when I closed a window.  Everything looked OK, but it just
wouldn't work.  I ran Dis 2.1 and it said that Finder Sounds had a
corrupted data fork.  So I removed it from the system folder and
continued on.

Later that day, I tried to print out a Word file on my PaintJet and I
got a "The application 'Microsoft Word' has unexpectedlly quit (1)" I
tried again and got the same message.  I tried again with the printer
set to draft mode only (the other attempts had been "Best" mode) and
it worked.  Hmmm.

This morning, Iwas editing an AutoCad drawing and the printer began
printing out a constant stream of three ascii characters in a
repeating pattern whenever the mouse was idle.  As soon as I moved it
or clicked, the printer would stop until the mouse was idle and I
wasn't in the middle of a command.  Then, suddenly, it stopped
printing when the mouse was idle and began to do it whenever the
pointer was moved off of the drawing window and onto a scroll bar or
pull down menu (as long as the button is not depressed) I should point
out that no printer was selected on chooser.  In fact, I had selected
another printer just to see if I could make it stop doing this.  No
luck.

I have tried reinstalling the system (6.0.5), rebuilding the desktop,
runnig with Finder on and Multifinder off and vice versa.  The only
recent change to my system has been a Kensington Turbo ADB Mouse that
is installed in the same port as my old mouse had been in.  That was a
hardware change only, no software was involved.

As you can probably tell, I am a new Mac user, and know little about
the inner workings of this thing.  It could be a hardware problem, but
the seemingly unrelatedness and weirdness of these problems makes me
think that, I can't stop myself from saying this, my APPLE has a WORM
in it.

Anything sound familiar to anyone?

Subject: Soviet Viruses

Some time ago, I posted an inquiry about viruses in the USSR.  Thanks
for responding to Y. Radai, Fridrik Skulason, Dimitri Vulis, Werner
Klotzbuecher, E.  Shapira, Aryeh Goretsky, and a person who prefers to
remain anonymous.

My article on computerization in the USSR was printed in
COMPUTERWORLD, In Depth Section, August 20, 1990, 73-74.  For Virus-L
readers, here are the major findings regarding viruses.

One of the earliest publicized cases of a computer virus in the USSR
occurred in 1988, when an unidentified programmer at the Gorky
Automobile Works on the Volga River was charged with deliberately
using a virus to shut down an assembly line in a dispute over work
conditions.  The man was convicted under Article 206, the so-called
hooliganism law, which provides for a jail term of up to six years for
(quote) violating public order in a coarse manner and expressing a
clear disrespect toward society.(end quote)

Pirated software appears all over the USSR and the Soviets often get
hit with viruses when they buy copies via the Hong Kong or Swiss
connections.  There are also several Bulgaria contributions. Aryeh
Goretsky at McAffee Associates says that there have been confirmed
attacks of Yankee Doodle, Vacsina, Microsoft88 (534), Sunday, Amstrad
or Pixel, Disk Killer 170X, Stoned, Ping Pong, Vienna, Jerusalem,
Friday the 13th COM, Pakistani Brain, Disk Killer and W-13.
Anti-virus program in the USSR are AIDSTEST by Lozynky and ANTI-KOT
and ANTI-KOR by Kotik.  Some Western anti-virus programs and some
homegrown verisons are also available there.

While the Soviet computerists whom I met are aware of the virus
threat, there is a general lack of organizational preparedness to meet
the challenge.  Soviet hackers, forces from out side the borders, and
even some political or ideological persons may set off viruses in the
near future.  Several of the experts I met knew how to creat a virus
and others certainly know how to get copies. More than likely, viruses
will be sold or traded as so many other commodity are.

Since perestroika is heavily based on rapid computerization of
enterprises, virus created disruptions could mean serious disruptions
of basic economic restructuring efforts.

Further comments are found in the full article.

Subject: Interaction Between Security Programs (Mac)

A correspondent to this forum recently mentioned an odd interaction
between two viral scanners on the PC, where one of them identified the
list of viral signatures used by the other one as containing the
viruses.  I have observed a different type of odd interaction between
anti-viral packages on the Macintosh.  The virus scanner Virex and the
security package A.M.E. (Access Managed Environment) have been
installed on a Macintosh.  If a diskette containing new applications
is inserted into a drive, Virex attempts to scan the diskette for
virus signatures.  However, A.M.E. intercepts the scan and puts up a
message saying that an attempt is being made to open an unregistered
item of software.  It allows the system administrator to bypass
registration or to cancel the open, but warns that bypassing the
requirement for registration is dangerous.  If the diskette contains a
new release of previously installed software (an update), it puts up
an even more strongly worded warning that an attempt is being made to
open an altered copy of a registered program and that it may have
viruses.  The message may confuse an inexperienced system
administrator because she may assume that an attempt is being made to
EXECUTE an unregistered or altered application.  In fact, Virex is
opening the applications to READ them to scan for viruses.  The proper
response is to bypass the A.M.E. registration check at this point.
Cancelling the open causes the diskette to be ejected.

If the user is not the system administrator, A.M.E. does not offer the
bypass option.  It simply cancels the open.  This is reasonable since
in a controlled environment only the system administrator should be
loading new programs.

The specific moral to this concerns the interaction between A.M.E.
and Virex.  The general moral to this is that anti-viral programs may
interact with each other oddly, and that they do require expert
knowledge of what the virus threat is and what the other threats are
and what they are doing to protect the users.

Subject: Virus in Sound Effect (MAC)

     A co-worker a few months ago had a problem that should be
mentioned.  He picked up some free disks containing some installable
sound effects for a Macintosh.  He knew that he should scan any
applications or desk accessories for viruses.  It didn't occur to him
to scan sound effects.  He installed them without using a virus
checker, although a commercial virus scanner was was installed.  He
probably thought sound effects were harmless.  (They are, unless they
have viruses.)  Shortly thereafter he noticed that 75M of his 80M hard
disk was in use, and that the system and various applications had
increased in size.  At this point he scanned for viruses and found
multiple infections by nVIR.  The version of nVIR that he had picked
up was (like many subspecies of nVIR) extremely virulent and produced
very many copies of itself.  An installable sound effect is of course
a resource, and on the Macintosh anything having a resource fork can
be infected by viruses.  There would seem to be a moral to this: Check
everything, even things that you don't think are subject to viral
infections.

On the Macintosh, viruses are not limited to the System or
applications, but anything having a resource fork.  On IBM-compatible
PC's, viruses can be not only in .COM and .EXE but in other types of
code such as .OBJ or .BIN.

Even if the WDEF virus for the mac contained such a test, it would
still probably be the case that "the virus causes the Mac IIci, the
IIfx, and the Portable to crash almost immediately after insertion of
an infected floppy."  (Disinfectant 2.1 help screen)

The issue is the same here.  The author of the wdef virus didn't have
any of these machines to test the virus on at the time (most of them
weren't released yet (I don't know the exact timing)).  But they are
all supported by system 6.0.5.

There's no way to write that test correctly.  Virus writers can't test
for machines they don't know about.
