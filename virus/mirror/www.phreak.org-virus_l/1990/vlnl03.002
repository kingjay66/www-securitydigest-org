VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Network server infections (PC)

I received a note in the mail recently asking about viruses infecting network
file servers. Since the reply might be of general interest, I am also posting
it here.

Boot sector viruses will not spread via the network, but most program viruses
are able to do so, under certain circumstances.

Assume we have two users, A and B connected to the network. 'A' runs by
accident an infected program. The virus (assuming it is not of the Direct
Action type) will stay resident and monitor the execution of other programs.
Now, if 'A' runs a (non-infected) program located on the network server, the
virus will try to infect it as it is executed.

If the network software is able to make the files read-only or execute-only
and the user can not change that with an ATTRIB -R command, the virus will
not be able to infect the programs on the server.

However, if 'A' is the supervisor or somebody else with write access, the
virus will be able to infect the programs on the server. Later, when 'B' runs
an infected program from the server, his machine will be infected and also the
programs located there.

Subject: December 24. virus (PC)

On December 24. several PCs here in Iceland refused to run any programs,
displaying the message "Gledileg Jol" instead. On Dec. 25th everything was
back to normal.

This seems to be a new .EXE infecting virus of Icelandic origin, possibly a
variant of the Icelandic-1 virus.

A full description will be posted as soon as I receive a sample.

Subject: December 24th virus (PC)

I just received a sample of the "December 24th" virus I reported on
VALERT-L earlier today. As I suspected, the virus is just a new
variant of the Icelandic virus, or rather a variant of Icelandic-2.

The major changes I have seen are:

        The virus length is now 848-863 bytes

        If an infected program is run on December 24th, any attempt to
        run another program later that day will just produce the message
        "Gledileg Jol" (Icelandic for "Merry Christmas").

        The creation date of infected files is not changed.

        A few NOP instructions have been added.

Apart from this, the virus seems very similar to Icelandic-2. (Infects only
.EXE files, only 1 out of 10, bypasses INT 21 etc.)

More details later, when I have had the time to disassemble the entire virus.

Subject: Bug in Virus Buster 1.10 (PC)

I would like to report about a bug that was found in Virus Buster 1.10.

Virus Buster will not remove some EXE viruses from the file. Instead,
it would make them unavailable. The new version of Virus Buster will
be released soon with those bugs fixed.

Truly sorry,

I'm not sure that writing viruses will ever stop.

Ross Greenberg wrote perhaps the best psychological profile of the
"virus programmer" that I have ever read.  (It's in the docs of
FLUSHOT, you've all read it...)

 The virus writer likes causing damange.  He thinks it's funny and makes him
feel powerful.  You can bet that most of them are reading what is written
here.  Just look at the worldwide scope of the current AIDS virus scam.  To
this day, tha STONED virus still infects thousands of systems all over the
world.  (Poorly written as it is..)

The target of many virus writers are the millions of PC users who don't know
much about computers.  The novice user, or perhaps the user who knows how to
run programs but does not know much about DOS, is the primary mark.  A friend
of mine was just such a person.  Less than 20 days after buying his PC he was
hit by the STONED virus.  He did not know how to protect himself.  Lots of
grins for the programmer.

There will always be socially retarded morons to write virus programs.  There
is only one way to stop them - cold.  Forums such as this. It is possible that
this very ECHO stopped and cured the AIDS virus...  I wonder how many
thousands of PC users did not install that "program" thanks to what they read
here.

BACKUPS!!!!!

Hi,
Could somebody send me information about the YANKEE DODDLE virus, and
a disinfector,
Thanx in advance

Well for floppy disks there is a program to rewrite boot sectors
and its called  sys.com try reading you dos manuals. If the disk
does not have room for a system use debug
L 0 0 0 1
        to read a clean boot sector from disk in drive A
W 0 1 0 1
        to write over the infected disk in drive B note the disk can
be a non bootable disk ie no system and still have the virus on it. ie
even if you boot it and it reports no system on disk please insert dos
disk , it has loaded the virus in memandy and infected your harddisk
(if you have one). If you have an infected harddisk get either norton
disk doctor or McFee's virus software.
