VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

"Not so, Mr. Schuyler!"

That is a very large NO, and I do not wish to get into a shouting match
with my learned colleague.  Neither do I wish for the rest of you to be
mislead.

First, I think that my colleague speaks in the very narrow sense of
MS-DOS.  While this is the important territory for the moment, it is not
all there is.

Ken Thompson, in his Turing Award acceptance, describes a very credible
scenario of a virus in source code.  He makes the relevant point.  "One
man's data is another man's program."

There is very credible evidence that a 1-2-3 .wks file, which looks for
all the world like a data file, can contain a macro which will create a
copy of itself in all .wks files such that use of those will cause
further copies.  That sounds like a virus to me.

It is not clear that such a .wks file could achieve the feat of
infecting .exe or .com files.  And it is clear that it can only execute
in a 1-2-3 environment.  It cannot operate in a DOS, UNIX, or primitive
hardware environment.  But that was a BIG no, we do not wish to mislead,
One man's data is another's program, and not everyone operates in a DOS
only environment.

My point is that anyone can tell a lie a in any language.  Whenever you
accept ANY data from another, you run some risk of being duped.  While
it is true that the virus writer must solve the problem of getting his
program in control, and that that problem is more easily solved in some
environments than in others, do not under-estimate the ingenuity of the
malicious.

While the current battle is being waged on the PC battlefield, and while the
war may even be won or lost here, the phenomenon should be known in the
broadest and most general light.

Subject: FTP from SIMTEL20 to VM/CMS (Internet)

 Michael,

      It sounds like I've had the same problems you've had when trying to FTP
 Disinfectant.  I can successfully FTP Disinfectant to my VM/XA SP2 CMS
 minidisk, but when it comes time to download it to a Mac, the file is all
 garbled.  In spite of several months of trying, I have still never
 successfully obtained Disinfectant over the Internet.  I believe the problem
 has something to do with 7 databit vs. 8 databit binary.  However, I just
 FTP'd the following help file from SIMTEL20.  Although it's not Mac-specific
 and I haven't tested it yet, I think the FTP command TYPE L 8 is the missing
 link.  Hope this helps....

[Ed. SIMTEL20 is a TOPS-20 system, which is 36 (!) bit based - this
confuses many systems, but most FTP implementations can handle it.  On
UNIX systems, issue the "tenex" command at the "ftp>" prompt to set
the data type appropriately.]

 ---------------------------------------
 This file is presented for those who wish to transfer BINARY(8) files
 from SIMTEL20.ARPA to IBM/CMS hosts.

 Re:   SIMTEL20->CMS->DOS Success

 I recently requested help transferring files from SIMTEL20 to my micro via
 an IBM mainframe.  After reading several replies (thanks :-) and
 experimenting a bit, I have succeeded.  The trick is to issue the FTP
 command TYPE I followed by TYPE 8 before transferring a file (actually,
 TYPE 8, TYPE 32, and QUOTE TYPE seem to have the same effect).

 A few details: I am using MS-Kermit 2.30 and a modem to connect my micro
 to an IBM 4381 via a Series/1 protocol converter.  The 4381 is running
 CMS.  I use FTP on the 4381 to connect to SIMTEL20.  The following
 "recipe" successfully transferred the file from FTP to my micro:

 1)  start up FTP on the 4381 and connect to SIMTEL20
 2)  issue the FTP command TYPE I
 3)  issue the FTP command TYPE L 8
     (or TYPE L 32 or QUOTE TYPE L 8)
 4)  use the FTP command CWD to get to the right SIMTEL20 directory
 5)  use the FTP command GET to transfer the file to the 4381
 6)  use the FTP command QUIT to log off SIMTEL20 and shut down FTP
 7)  start up CMS-Kermit on the 4381
 8)  issue the CMS-Kermit command SET FILE-TYPE BINARY (MS-Kermit doesn't
 need to be "told" that the file type is binary, but other communications
 packages, such as ProComm, do need to be "told")
 9)  use the two Kermits to transfer the file from the 4381 to my micro
 10) "unarc" the file if it is an ARC file (I use ARCE30F).

 The FTP commands TYPE L 8, TYPE L 32, and QUOTE TYPE L 32 seemed to have
 identical effects.  The copies of the file were the same length according
 to both CMS and DOS, and ARCE30F was able to "unarc" all three.

 The FTP command TYPE L 8 was inadequate unless preceded by TYPE I The FTP
 command TYPE I was inadequate unless followed by TYPE L 8, TYPE L 32, or
 QUOTE TYPE L 8.  The version of FTP I use does not recognize the TENEX
 command.

Subject: Viruses in Data

Fred Cohen uses the term "transitivity" to describe the potential of
data to flow between compartments within a system.  However, the term is
also used to describe the propensity for data to become a program.  That
is, how likely is the data to influence the behavior of the system.

Let us take for example an ATM.  I can put data in it.  The data that I
put in influences the behavior of the system in a limited way.  It would
not be fair to say that it has no influence at all.

On the other hand, it cannot cause any change to the program library of
the ATM or of the host system.  I would have great difficulty entering a
virus through such a portal.  I would have difficulty entering any data
that could cause an unintended copy of itself, executable or otherwise,
through such portal.

It is possible to think of restricting the generality of a port, or even
of a whole computer, such that its programs  cannot be modified in any
way.  An arcade game is an example;  a user can hardly enter data that
will persist longer than the privilege afforded by one twenty-five cent
token.  The program may be stored in read-only storage.  Yet, somehow I
persist in believing that the originator of that program reserved to
himself to make late modifications to the program.

Does not this reserved privilege contain the potential to enter
malicious changes?

Cohen asserts that one way to deal with the virus problem would be to
move to application-only machines.  Others who have posted to this list
insist that the virus problem is caused, not by the size of the
population of PCs, but by the generality of its architecture and the
ease with which programs can be changed.

Are there useful lines, between these two extreme, that we can draw?

ChessMaster 2100 & WDEF A

At ComputerWare, we found out that the game ChessMaster 2100 (by Software
Toolworks) is recognized by SAM, GateKeeper, and other anti-viral programs
as containing RWDEF A.S We found that GateKeeper found RWDEF AS on a number of
 UNOPENED boxes of the game that we pulled off the shelf in our warehouse.

At first, Software Toolworks denied that they were distributing a
virus-infected product, but they are looking into the matter.

Can anyone confirm or deny this? Hope to hear some feedback on this one...

How many times has this question been answered?  If you can't execute
the file or run it via an interpreter it can't carry a virus.  If its
source code for a compiler or interpreter the danger is present that
it contains malicious instructions but visual inspection can quickly
settle that.  Most viruses are on PC class machines and are specific
to one architecture.  Moving a text file from a mainframe to a PC is
about as safe as you can get without typing with c*****ms on your
fingers.  The rest is all chicken little syndrome from people who
don't know what they're talking about.  (Sorry if that sounded a bit
hot, I've been fighting a running battle with the chicken little types
about it.)  BTW, Modem viruses and setup memory viruses are also
fictional for the same reason, its simply not possible to execute
them.

Subject: Re: Virus in Text Files

It is possible for a text file to contain ansi instructions to remap
your keyboard, e.g., mapping a format or a global delete command (with
the appropriate response to any y/n query) to a single key.

This is not a virus, but it can be considered a trojan horse.

The ansi command will only take effect if the file is typed to the
screen; merely having it around does no harm, nor does looking at it
with other types of file viewers.

Ansi commands will only work if you are running an ansi driver of some
sort.  Keyboard remapping only works if you have configured your
ansi driver to allow it.  I use PC Magazine's ansi.com version 1.3 and
configure it to disallow keyboard remapping.

<not equal to>VIR is the application signature of Interferon.  VIRx is
the app sig of early versions of VIREX, VIRy is the app sig of the current
VIREX, and for all I know, VIRz will be the app sig of some future version

There's one class of text files that can easily carry viruses: program
source files. See my "usenet virus" article (first posted shortly
before the Internet Worm incident, reposted periodically whenever
assertions that text files or source code files are safe come up) for
more on this subject... or just consider the Obfuscated C Contest.

 Yes dave but under environments which use say the VM8086 model on the
386 (such as VPIX) file writability and/or hardware acces is TOTALLY
under the control of unix... weak unix security weak dos security good
unix security = good dos security in this case....

 Agreed no NON executable file can be used to infect however another
technique without providing examples would be the case of a bat file
being used to feed debug along with infectious code(SMALL) being kept
beyond the EOF marker in the last allocated cluster... note all DOS
routines(I/O) read the Entire cluster(not just up to EOF...) this can
be quite a bit of spare space on present drives... more ambitious
schemes would be a triply/redundant encrypted shadow file system using
either Hamming or other ER schemes such as Reed Solomon...this could
be used to store quite sophisticated system
penetration/Interdiction/ICE-Breakers...  with out visibility to
normal virus scanners(most use the FAT and/or Directory Structures to
analyze the disk...) this vunerability does in certain cases extend to
other OS's besides **-DOS.... Something indeed to think about....still
another reason to upgrade completely to MMU managed
architectures(386/486 etc) using the VM8086 model ...

We've got a problem with a bunch of Mac SE, and SE 30. We have gotten
a virus into them somehow. I have no idea how this could have
happened, since they are not networked together (other than
Appletalk), and we know 99.99995 of our software is store boughten,
right off the shelves. I'm not that familiar with Mac viruses, but
here are the symptoms:

- --It just eats up space, and makes everythink larger. It sort of became
  evident when our 20 meg hd was 27 megs...

- --It may or may not copy itself onto floppy disks that are put into the
 system.

- --It seems to have been gotten rid of, and then it comes back.

- --When we find the virus on the SE (These don't have hds) we seem to get rid
of it.

- --The plain SE gets it from when a disk was carried from the SE/30 to the reg.
  SE. So, I know where it's coming from.

Can you please tell me what this Virus is, and how to stop it??? We
try to use the SE/30 as least as possible, so it's down 75% of the
time, so I think the virus can be left alone untill we get some
antidotes here. We have tried one (a store one, can't remember the
name), that doesn't seem to help it.

I really need some suggestions...

        Dave, I agree with you fully and I think that the Virus
Discussion List and/or John McAfee himself should post the validate
strings to the *NET*

In fact, a list of must commonly used programs should be included on
such a list, but for now the validated strings of the lastest versions
for the scan and clean programs should be publically accessible.  Many
people will hesitate from getting an updated version because it may be
a virus in disguise.  After people can be assured that the program is
valid, then they could get the new copy and register it.
