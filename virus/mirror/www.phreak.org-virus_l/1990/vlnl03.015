VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Well, Academic Press finally came through!  You will recall that
the Barnsley DESKTOP FRACTAL DESIGN SYSTEM, sold through Academic
Press, was infected with a virus named "1813".  At the time I reported
this to Academic Press's Customer Service department, they knew about
the problem.  Yesterday I received a letter from them dated January
12 (about 2 days after I reported the virus) noting that some copies
of the program are "suspected of carrying a computer virus."  The
letter directs purchasers to call the Customer Service Department
to order a clean copy and get directions for how to clean up your
system.

I'm not sure why it took them so long, but at least AP is taking
responsibility.  I imagine their senior executives are holding
their aching heads and wondering why they decided to enter the
software publishing business.  Books never require product recalls.

Subject: Hard Drive Overlord (PC)

I am trying to get information on a programme called Hard Drive
Overlord which is published by A.B. Data Sales, Inc. of Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, Canada.

It comes with five modules and seems to be similar to GateKeeper (Mac)
in function.  With all the discussion on the list about software, it's
hard to imagine why this one hasn't been mentioned before.

Please reply directly to me and I'll post a summary back.

Subject: Re: Spool... Bug or Virus, what is more harmful

  Some Digests ago there was a message saying that our errors are more
dangerous than virus. Could both of them be viewed in the same
perspective? Could "vaccines" be developed for both?

Second Point:
  Lately I receiving lots of RETURNED NETWORK from LISTSERVERS. I think
that it could cause, in extreme case, a traffic so large in the net
that it would collapse.

  Question: In this case, the LISTSERV will be considered a Virus (expecting
to get active)? Or the users that don't disconnect itself from servers are
guilty of bad use (non-ethical) of a computer program?

  Although it is not the place, I suggest that LISTSERVERs receive an
ANTI-MESSAGE protection to solve this specific problem, but I'm worried
with the generalization of this question.

[Ed. Believe it or not, LISTSERVs actually attempt to parse incoming
mail to determine whether it is a bounced error message (in which case
the mail gets forwarded to me...) or a legitimate posting.
Unfortunately, postmasters and sites don't use any standard format
error message, and the LISTSERV occasionally is "tricked" into
believing that an error is actually a message for the list.  Instant
loop, just add water.  Those of you on VALERT-L may be relieved to
know that I *think* that the problem is fixed.  I know, I know -
famous last words...  :-)]

It was interesting to hear about the sequel of the Internet-worm-story.
For our newspapers didn't mention anything about the trial, I'd like to
hear in this newsgroup, what's going on, and what will happen to Mr. Morris.
Thanks.

Well, I've never met RJW, so I don't qualify as a friend of his, but
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Penn, so I'm definitely
educated and presumably bright as well (at least I like to thing so).
I was just selected to serve on a jury even though I mentioned during
the selection process that I was a PhD student.  So I guess it's not
impossible.

>From VIRUS-L:

>a violation of ethical aspects of computer use.

I suspect the conclusion of the authorities at Cornell that young Morris
acted with "reckless disregard" for the consequences is the closest that
we will ever get to an ethical judgement about his actions.

>I suggest that a ethical code, similar to the ethical code in

Of course the ACM does have such a code, and it is likely that young
Morris has or would subscribe to it.  However, it did not deter him.
Since his lawyer plans for him to testify, we will likely get to hear
his rationale for his behavior.  However, I doubt that he seriously
considered the ethics of his actions until confronted with the
consequences.

Had he done so, I am not sure that it would have altered his behavior.
Like many of his defenders in the net, I suspect that he would have seen
as ethical, or as not an ethical issue.  There does not seem to be a
concensus among his contemporaries that that kind of behavior is
reprehensible.  Neither does there appear to be a concensus among them
that they have an interest in an orderly playground.

Note that though Morris aspires to be a professional in the field, and
is, therefore, subject to professional sanctions, most of his
contemporaries who use computers have no such aspirations and are not
subject to such sanctions.

It seems equally clear that this profession does not have sufficient
integrity to inoke such sanctions.  Though Cornell concluded that he
did it (and he does not deny it), they have said that he is eligible
to re-apply for admission to continue his studies.  Other
"responsible" members of the profession have been willing to employ
him.  Thus his contemporaries could conclude that, while such actions
might be in technical violation of the ACM's code, they are not in
violation of community standards.

If the profession and society are to be protected from such impolite,
disorderly, and destructive behavior, then we must reach a collective
conviction we are prepared to consistently support in both
voice and action.  In the absence of such a concensus, we can expect
more of the same.

TO ANYBODY FIGHTING THE JERUSALEM/1813 VIRUS ON THE "DESKTOP FRACTAL
DISK"

There are two articles which explain the action of the virus and give
details of anti-viral programs to eradicate it:

Joe Hirst Getting inside PC viruses. Tech PC User may 1989 v1 n9 p22(5)

Powis, Kevin Programs to fight viruses. Tech PC User May 1989 v1 n9 p31(3)

The program to fight Jerusalem/1813 is called 1813BR, it's PD and you
can get it from the CoTRA conference on CIX

Subject: WDEF at University of Oregon (Mac)

Since people seem to be reporting occurrences of the WDEF virus, hopefully
to track its spread, I will throw in my two cents worth.

The WDEF virus was reported in the student computer lounge around January
8th.  The virus was removed using Disinfectant 1.5.  The computer lounge
has a voluntary virus check station.  The WDEF virus has been detected and
removed a number of times since the 8th.

I am writing from the University of Oregon Academic Computing Center.  We
have not seen the WDEF virus yet.  We scan numerous disks that are brought
into our public printing and public domain (both for Macintosh) stations.
We have exclusively seen Nvir A and B.  I informally track virus reports
from around the city (Eugene, Oregon) and have only received reports of
Nvir A and B.

On the PC side I have dealt with the Jerusalem virus once, and the Ping-
Pong virus once.  The Jerusalem virus was spread from a BBS in Portland,
Oregon.  No other PC viruses have been reported to our center.

Obviously, we have been lucky, so far.  One of my duties is virus removal
and prevention for PC and Macintosh at our center.  I receive numerous
calls for information and help from the campus community and the community
in general.

     The Microtimes third annual selection of the 100 most influential
leaders in the computer industry (published in the January 22 edition)
includes John McAfee for his work in the computer virus field.  To see
a virus researcher included with such luminaries as Steven Jobs, Bill
Gates, Mitch Kapor, Peter Norton, John Akers (Chairman of the Board of
IBM), Phillipe Kahn etc. implies that the establishment has finally
taken the virus issue seriously.  It's even more interesting when you
consider that Steve Wozniak, Brian Carlson, the Chairmen of ICL,
Intel, Olivetti, and the presidents of dozens of major computer
manufacturers were turned down for inclusion.
     I say hats off to a hard working representative of the antivirus
league and congratulations -- in spite of John's self deprecating
attitude (He claims that they confused him with someone else and that
his inclusion and description of his deeds can be attributed to an
editorial oversight).

I may be missing something, but it seems the above program makes the
assumption that A cannot detect some virus.  If A can detect all
virisus then P1 will in fact be unable to infect another program and
is thus not a virus.

Why not just run a good virus checker on returned software  before rewrapping?

IMO, if someone evilminded really intends to infect a disk will
succeed even on write protected disks. On the other hand, verifying a
returned disk with a master copy as dmg@retina.mitre.org (David
Gursky) suggests is time intensive and annoys the customers. Vendors
should put a new media i.e. a copy from a clean master diskette into
the box and then shrink-wrap it.
