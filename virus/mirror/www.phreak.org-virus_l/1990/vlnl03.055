Sorry about the delay in getting this digest out, folks.  We've been
re-organizing our internal network somewhat...  As a result, I have a
new email address: krvw@CERT.sei.cmu.edu.  The old address,
krvw@sei.cmu.edu will continue to work, but the new one is preferred -
also, outgoing digests and news are now being sent from the new
address.

Sorry about any inconvenience.

A user on campus reports the following message:

"Disk Killer V1.0 by Computer Ogre 4/1/89" along with "Do not turn off
this machine or remove the disk from the drive during processing".  An
older version of McAfee's program did not find any information.  As
far as the system owner can tell, no data has been damaged.  Has
anyone encountered this program before, and have any ideas on what to
do about it?

Just as additional Note due to a pecularity in Pakistani law ...
there is NO Copyright Law.... Mohammed wasnt selling copies of his own

  There are some bad assumptions in the above. 1) PCs cannot read
Macintosh formatted floppies, unless you have some sort of hardware
specifically made for that purpose. 2) WDEF travels when an infected
disk is inserted into a an UNPROTECTED Mac. 3) There is a free,
easy-to-use program called GateKeeper- Aid that, when placed in the
System Folder of the startup disk, will kill WDEF on ANY disk
"touched" by the Mac at startup time or any time before a reboot.  If
you have an infected Mac and you put GateKeeper-Aid in your Sys Folder
and reboot, you no longer have WDEF. From that point on, just
inserting an infected disk will activate GK-A, which will remove WDEF.
Real simple. Expense: ~10K on the startup disk.
  Aside from the facts that PCs don't read Mac disks and WDEF is the
easiest virus to prevent/stop/remove/be-rid-of, someone would have to
write the soft- ware for the PC that recognizes the resource fork of
files that Macs use. This is not a minimal task, whereas a Mac program
that uses the Mac's OS is pretty trivial to write. Other virii are a
bit more difficult to remove, but still not at all difficult. (The
changes they make are known and the reversal of such changes is almost
always a simple remove XX and YY, copying this bit of data from XX
which was originally here in ZZ, part of the REAL program. OK, take my
word for it -- this is NOT the programming challenge of the year by a
long shot.) The removal is the easy part. Reading a Mac disk without
the Macs OS is bit more of a trick.

  I *think* you refer to the way that Macs respond to a disk being
inserted automatically whereas PCs don't care. A Mac CAN read MS/DOS
1.4MB floppies (not all Mac models, though...) and the mounting prob
could be worked around, but overall, using a completely different
computer to scan a given disk is quite a programming challenge (at
least in one direction) not to mention, chances are that anything the
non-native virus checker found would certainly be detectable/treatable
at a much earlier date by a native virus checker. And would you be
willing to lag behind a few months after a virus became wide- spread
before you could stop or deal with it?

  I don't know enough of the PC world to comment about this, but for
Macs, the virus prevention combo of GateKeeper-Aid and Vaccine will
stop all the virii *I* know of from spreading. GK-A will remove WDEF
infections and Vaccine will either flag suspicious modifications
attempted by virii, or crash, both of which give a pretty good
indication a virus is present. If you dedicate a Mac to checking for
virii (an admittedly expensive proposition -- if one Mac has
Multifinder running, keeping Disinfectant going is an elegant sort of
solution) you could have Vaccine and GK-A in the Sys Folder and have
Disinfectant (a free, thorough detection/removal program) running in a
mode where it scans any floppy inserted into a drive and removes any
virii found, spitting the floppies out after its done. A dedicated Mac
could even have the mouse removed, effectively crippling it for any
other uses.

  I think that's just what about what I suggested, more or less. In
summary, using a PC to disinfect Mac disks is an interesting idea, but
more likely it is a lot more trouble than it's worth. The mac virii
are easy to catch with currently available software. WDEF, the most
virulent virus I know of, is also the easiest to stop. (If someone
happens to be using a Mac that has GK-A in the Sys Folder, just pop in
your disk for a sec, and if WDEF is there, you'll find out, and then
it will be gone! No need to interrupt work to run a virus scanning
application!)
  Vaccine will stop all other virii that I know of from spreading, but
you must 1) have it on the startup disks used to so that Vaccine is
present when the virus tries to move, usually with the starting of a
program and 2) run a virus scanning program to find and remove a
stopped virus.
  Disinfectant will find and remove all the known Mac virii and is
easy to use.

  All the mentioned software is 100% free and easily accessible on the
net, most notably the info-mac archives at Sumex-aim.stanford.edu.

  If your Macs have hard disks, put GK-A and Vaccine in the Sys
Folder, and you'll stop all the virii I know of from spreading. If you
use floppy system (OSU does at the moment...), at least put GK-A and
Vaccine on any startup disks you provide and it will be pretty obvious
when a virus shows up, at which point Disinfectant can remove the
virus causing the problem.

Disclaimer: I've re-read this a couple times for accuracy. All the
above is to the best of mine knowledge true, and is definitely true in
spirit. (Any challenges?) If there are any errors or questions, send
me mail and I'll try to help.
  The virus problem on the Mac is not a difficult one to deal with,
even though in a public lab you will have more people than you can
believe bringing in infected disks. The best we can do is "the BEST we
CAN do." That includes letting users know what is going on and trying
to explain how to practice safe HEX, etc. (A nice LARGE posting in a
prominent place could save a LOT of aggravating questions. A flyer
would also be nice to give more detailed info for those who ask. That
will cut the number of questions down dramatically...)

A LAST LITTLE NOTE ON SOMETHING BEING DONE TO HELP PUT THIS VIRUS
STUFF BEHIND ALL OF US

  I have read somewhere here in the news that Apple put out a note
mentioning that copy protection schemes on the Mac were likely to fail
with some unspecified new hardware. (I don't know of any time frame on
this...) Basically, they said that it would not be possible to access
the hardware from software, I presume as a safety measure to prevent
virii and other similar ilk from doing damage by bypassing the OS.
This will be a welcome change. If anyone from Apple is reading this,
THANKS IN ADVANCE! Hopefully this is just ONE measure in defending our
computers against virii.
  I would like to see EVERY manufacturer take such measures. (Note
that you can always rest assuered that a locked floppy [the write
protect tab set to lock] on a Mac is a READ ONLY disk as the Mac
drives use a hardware interlock.) Still, the above development is much
much much better.

Subject: Is the Joker a virus? (PC)

Some of you may have a copy of the Joker (or Jocker) program from Poland,
the one that arrived in the same package as the W13 and Vcomm viruses.

The question is - is this program a virus ?

I have not yet been able to get it to replicate, but McAfee claims it
is a virus.

So, those of you with a copy of the program - please send me a note if
you have been able to make it behave like a virus.

While on the subject of the Polish viruses - we really need a
different name for the Vcomm virus.  The reason for the name is that
the disassembly was named VCOMM.ASM.  However, it had been created by
the program SOURCER, from "V communications" (an exellent product, by
the way) but because the virus is in no way connected the company, the
name is hardly suitable.

Any suggestions ?  "Polish virus" ?  "Polish EXE virus" ?

I've tried to read an 800K CP/M disk (formatted on a C-128) on a PC,
and the hardware just isn't capable of doing that. In this case, the
disks have 10 sectors/track, and PC drives can't read more than 9.  In
the case of the Mac, with variable speed drives, that sure wouldn't
work without hardware modifications. No way to change drive speed
through software.

We have just experienced a rash of Jerusalem B in our MS-Dos machines
in the Industrial Engineering complex.  I used McAfee's CLEANP
utility, but was unable to recover most of the files which were
infected - all it did was render the virus harmless (dead?).  The
doccumentation makes special note about Jerusalem B being the
exception to the effectiveness of this utility.  Has anybody got a
better utility for killing Jerusalem B virus?  It seems to be
constantly circling campus and I'm tired of having to restore from
backups.

Please E-mail suggestions or utilities to: marc@isye.gatech.edu (my IE

This is simply not true.  Very few nations do not have some form of
protection for literary and artistic works.  The U.S. is a signatory
of two important international treaties governing copyright.  The
oldest international con- vention is the Berne Convention, signed at
Berne, Switzerland by 10 nations on September 9, 1886, with major
revisions taking place at Paris, France in 1971.  Many nations are
signatories of that treaty.  As of 1986, 76 countries are Berne
members.  The U.S. only very recently became an adherent of this
convention.  (refer to the Berne Convention Implementation Act of
1988, which became effective March 1, 1989)

The Universal Copyright Convention, signed at Geneva, Switzerland on
September 6, 1952 is the other major international treaty, to which
the U.S. became a signatory on September 16, 1955.  As of October 1,
1988, 78 nations adhere to this convention.  There are also other
international treaties (the Buenos Aires Convention is one of them)
and bilateral copyright relations existing between many nations.

The fundamental principle of these international treaties is that
copyright protection is based upon "national treatment."  That is to
say that works entitled to the benefits of the conventions enjoy in
each member country the advantages given to the works of nationals of
the country where protection is sought.  This is to say that depending
on the date of copyrighted works, there is a great deal of protection
available for your works that might have been let loose in another
country within that very country by virtue of the international
copyright treaties currently in place.  Enforcing them is, of course,
the duty of copyright owners, but they do have a considerable judicial
forum in which to launch and protect the interests in their original
works of authorship.

If copyrighting viruses/trojan horses are excluded as proper subject
matter that qualify for copyright and can be registered in the
Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, then those who write
disassembler programs may be free to do so and claim copyright in
those programs without infringing the derivative work right of the
author of the virus code.

                                               Pete Lucas

The copyright issue is not an "irrelevant diversion."  The standards
of eligibility for securing copyright in marginal works of authorship,
is tied to the concept of "originality."  Apparently, pornographic
works meet the standards of originality and can be copyrighted - I'm
not sure if the Copyright Office refuses to register them.  If they do
allow registration, why not virus code, if an author is brazen or
stupid enough to formally register it?  I would hope that U.S.
lawmakers would disallow registration and exclude virus code from
proper subject matter.  This is probably wishful thinking.

Keep the copyright issues flowing and on the burner.

My understanding of the problem of the Farooq brothers is that they were
distributing (legally in Pakistan) pirated copies of software.  They
deliberately infected disks that they believed were going OUT of Pakistan
as distribution of the pirated stuff outside of their country was not
lawful.
