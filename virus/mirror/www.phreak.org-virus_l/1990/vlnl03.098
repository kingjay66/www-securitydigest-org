Subject: News from Bulgaria (PC)

The following article was written by Vesselin Bontchev from Bulgaria, who
is now back home and without E-Mail access.  It is possible to reach him
via a FidoNet BBS in Bulgaria, though.


     1. The Dark Avenger virus.
     - I found two new mutations of this virus. Well, maybe
"mutations" is not the correct word. In the first of them,
the first 16 characters of the string "Eddie lives...
somewhere in time!" were replaced with blanks. In the second
example, all strings (the message above, the copyright
message and the "Diana P." string) were replaced with
blanks.
     - The author of the Dark Avenger virus (The bastard! I
still cannot determine who he is.) has released the source
code of his virus. It is full with ironic comments about me.
Of course, now we have to expect lots of new, similar
viruses to appear. At least, this leaded to one good thing -
the source helped me very much in disassembling the V2000
virus.
     - I received a rather offensive anonymous letter from
this person. In it he claims to be also the author of both
the V2000 (I trust this) and the Number of the Beast viruses
(the latter is unlikely).

     2. The V2000 virus.
     - It turned out that the example of this virus I sent
to some of the antivirus researchers was not the original
version. The original contains the string "Only the Good die
young..." instead of the "Copy me - I want to travel"
message. Also a small piece of code in the original version
was patched to contain the "666" string. (That is, the
version you have contains this string, the original does
not.)
     - There exists also a small mutation of the version you
have. The only difference is that the `C' character in the
word "Copy" was changed to `Z'.
     - When describing the V2000 virus, I stated that it
halts the computer if you run a program which contains the
string "Copyright (c) 1989 by Vesselin Bontchev". This is
not quite correct. In fact, the programs are only checked
for the "Vesselin Bontchev" part of the string.
     - I obtained John McAfee's program Clean, version 60.
In the accompanying documentation he states about the V2000
virus that "The virus is very virulent and has caused system
crashes and lost data, as well as causing some systems to
become non-bootable after infection". This is not very
correct, or at least, there is much more to be said. The
virus is exactly as virulent as the Dark Avenger virus, and
for the same reason. It infects files not only when one
executes them, but also when one reads or copies them. This
is achieved exactly in the same manner as in the Dark
Avenger. The systems become non-bootable when the virus
infects the two hidden files of the operating system - it
cannot distinguish them from the regular .COM files. By the
way, the Dark Avenger virus often causes the same effect.
And at last, but not least (:-)), the virus is highly
destructive - just as the Dark Avenger is. It destroys the
information on a randomly selected sector on the disk once
in every 16 runs of an infected program. The random function
is exactly the same, and the counters (0 to 15 and for the
last attacked sector) are exactly the same and on the same
offsets in the boot sector as with the Dark Avenger virus.
The main difference is that the destroyed sector is
overwritten not with a part of the virus body, but with the
boot sector instead. This makes a bit more difficult to
discover which files are destroyed - the boot sector is
contained in many "good" programs, such as FORMAT, SYS, NDD.
Also, the nastiest thing - the damage function is not
performed via INT 26h (which can be intercepted). The virus
determines the address of the device driver for the
respective disk unit (using an undocumented DOS function
call, of course. I begin to wonder if Ralf Brown did any
good when he made the information in the INTERxyy file
available :-)). Then it performs a direct call to that
address. The device driver in DOS does its work and issues
the appropriate INT 13h. However the virus has scanned the
controllers' ROM space and has determined the original
address of the interrupt handler - just as the Dark Avenger
virus does. Then it has temporary replaced the INT 13h
vector with the address of this handler. The result is that
the damage function cannot be intercepted.
     - Also this virus (unlike Dark Avenger) supports PC-DOS
version 4.0 and will work (and infect) under it.
     - The bytes 84 A8 A0 AD A0 20 8F 2E in the virus body
are the name "Diana P.", this time written in cyrillics.

     3. The Number of the Beast.
     - Three new versions of this virus have appeared. None
of them contains the "666" string any more. I have
difficulties to tell the exact order in which these versions
were created. In all of them the virus writer has tried to
stick more code - but the place is *really* too small. In
one of them he abandoned the DOS version check; in
another there is no error checking. I call these versions
V512-B, V512-C and V512-D respectively. The bad news is that
John McAfee's program SCAN in no longer able to find them. I
do not think that this effect is achieved intentionally,
maybe John just picked a bad search string.
     - In these mutations some of the earlier design bugs in
the virus were improved. For instance, all of them are able
to extract correctly the name of the command interpreter on
boot time - even if it is not in the root directory. Also,
the infected program don't always exit at DOS prompt when
run on a clear system. The virus saves the first one (or
two, this depends of the concrete mutation) byte of the
original file in its own body. Then, when the infected file
is executed, the virus reads the first byte after the end of
file and compares it with the saved one. If these bytes
match, the virus tries read the original 512 bytes and to
execute the file. If they don't, the file is considered as
damaged and the virus terminates the program (and exits at
DOS prompt).
     - This virus contains a bug I didn't mentioned in my
description. This is a design bug, not a programmer's one.
The problem is that the virus is not always able to check
successfully if it is already present in memory. It compares
the program, which has intercepted the INT 21h vector with
its own body. However it does not try to be the first
program on this vector - like the Dark Avenger virus does.
Now suppose that your COMMAND.COM is infected and that you
have a lot of TSR programs in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, all of
which intercept INT 21h. Of course, each of them will become
infected. However each of them will cause a new copy of the
virus to be loaded also - since the first program has
intercepted INT 21h and the virus in the next program will
not be able to find that it is already present in memory.
Since every copy of the virus will occupy a DOS I/O buffer,
the operating system will run out of buffers soon. This will
lead to bad performance and system crashes.

     4. The Stoned (Marijuana, New Zealand) virus.
     This virus appeared in Bulgaria in late December, 1989.
I have a disassembly of it, made by Joe Hirst (I received it
from Morton Swimmer). (By the way, Joe Hirst's listings are
really excellent. But why he does not use mnemonic or at
least address-specific labels?) Unfortunately, the virus
which appeared in our country is not exactly the same.
According to Joe Hirst's listing, the virus places the
original partition sector of the infected hard disk on side
0, cylinder 0, sector 2. With the example I have, the place
is at side 0, cylinder 0, sector 7. This conforms better
with the description of the virus, made by Prof. Harold
Highland in "Computers & Security". Also some instructions
of Joe Hirst's listing have been optimized a bit (i.e., XOR
BX,BX instead of MOV BX,0). I really cannot understand why
this was done, since the virus fits on one sector and it is
useless to make it shorter. Another change is that the code
which displays the "Your PC is now Stoned" message is no
more implemented as a subroutine - since it is called only
once. Anyway, all the antivirus programs I have against this
virus, are able to recognize it and to cure the infected
disks. Therefore I conclude that this mutation is well known
in the Western countries.

     5. The Disk Killer (Ogre) virus.
     I received a report (along with an example) about this
virus on April 13, 1990 (another "Black Friday" :-)). The
virus was on a diskette, brought with a computer from
Taiwan. I would like to thank to Morton Swimmer, whose
disassembly listing of the virus helped me very much to
understand how the virus works and how to design a program
against it; and to Fridrik Skulason, whose antivirus package
F-PROT and especially the program F-DISINF was used as a
"first-aid" tool. John McAfee's Clean program is also able
to cure this virus, but it does not free the clusters marked
as bad. Interestingly enough, this virus contains a piece of
code, the purpose of which is to determine at boot time if
the virus is already present in memory. This is the first
boot sector infector I see which will not load itself
several times in memory if you boot from an infected
non-system disk and press several times the "any key" when
the appropriate message is displayed. By the way, has
anybody designed a program to recover from the damage done
by this virus? This has to be possible, since the virus
simply encrypts the sectors on your disk, XORing them with
0AAAAh and 5555h alternatively.

     6. The Amstrad virus.
     A new mutation of this virus was created in our
country. It is based on the 299 version, but the text
message has gone. Instead, there is a piece of code, which
causes PARITY ERROR with a probability of 1/2 when an
infected program is run. The new mutation is only 277 bytes
long. As far as I know, this is the shortest virus in the
IBM PC world. I really cannot understand why the virus
writers out there do bother to change such a stupid virus as
the Amstrad one is.

     7. The 4096 virus.
     No, we don't have this virus in Bulgaria, at least -
not yet. But Morton Swimmer gave me a copy of an infected
file. I studied it a bit and now I can say that this is the
virus which is the easiest one to get rid of. Just run an
infected file - to ensure that the virus is in memory. Then
for each directory of your disks execute the commands
          copy *.com nul
          copy *.exe nul
     After this turn the computer off to remove the virus
from memory. That's all - your files are no longer infected.

     8. The Toothless virus (V534).
     This virus came from the Soviet Union and is probably
created there. I have a Russian program against it. In the
accompanying documentation the virus is called "a version of
the 648 (Vienna) virus, made by a clumsy programmer". This
definition is quite exact. The virus is really very similar
to the Vienna one, with some parts of code removed and other
slightly changed. It is a non-resident virus. It infects
only .COM files in the current and in the root directory.
The directories, listed in the PATH variable are *not*
searched - the code for finding this variable in the
environment is entirely removed. The destructive function is
also removed. The infected files are marked not with a 62
seconds mark in their time of last update. Instead, a month
equal to 13 in the date of last update is used. This is
rather boring, since it can be easily seen (by obtaining a
directory listing) and some programs (e.g., Norton
Utilities) treat such things as "not a proper directory
entry". The virus increases the length of the infected files
by 534 bytes. Only files with length between 256 and 64000
bytes are attacked (the first of these numbers was 10 in the
Vienna virus). The virus is not very virulent - I have only
one report about it. The man who reported it brought me an
infected COMMAND.COM and said that its length had changed
once a bit - "about 500 bytes" - and the month in the file
date has changed to 13. When I was able to confirm that this
is indeed a new virus, I checked all his files, but found
nothing more than that infected COMMAND.COM.
     If the virus infects a file with the ReadOnly attribute
set, this attribute is cleared after the infection. This is
due to a bug in the virus code.
     The virus is assembled with a strange assembler (A86?).
Its disassembly listing cannot be assembled back with MASM
or TASM to produce exactly the same code.

     2. The Murphy viruses.
     The first of them appeared few weeks ago. It infects
both .COM and .EXE files, is memory resident,
non-destructive and infects files both when one executes or
just copies them. Its infective length is 1277 bytes. To be
infected, the files have to be greater than the infective
length. A closer look revealed that:
     - The most important parts of the virus were directly
got from the Dark Avenger virus. These include the
installation in memory, the controllers' ROM scan, the way
files are infected.

     - This is the first virus, which not only supports
PC-DOS version 4.0 (for instance V2000 does this), but also
uses it. It infects files also when the function 6C00h
(extended open/create) is executed.
     - If the virus is loaded in memory between 10 and 11
a.m., the computer's speaker is turned on and is reset on
every DOS function call. This emits a strange "shuffling"
noise - one can almost hear how the computer "thinks".
     - The virus contains the message " Hello, I'm Murphy.
Nice to meet you friend. I'm written since Nov/Dec.
Copywrite (c)1989 by Lubo & Ian, Sofia, USM Laboratory. ".
This message is never displayed. The "USM Laboratory" is
non-existent. "Lubo & Ian" do exist however. More about this
later.
     - The virus does not infect .COM files, greater than
64226 bytes. However, files greater than 64003 bytes refuse
to run when infected.
     - File type (.EXE vs. .COM) is determined both by the
file extension and by the file's first two bytes. The check
is made only for `MZ', not for `ZM'.
     - Since it is able to find the original INT 13h handler
(via the ROM scan - as the Dark Avenger virus does), the
virus cannot be stopped by a TSR which only hooks the INT
13h vector. It can be detected however, by programs such as
FluShot+, which look also for the Open-with-write-access
function (AX=3D02h; INT 21h).
     - The virus infects the command interpreter as soon as
an infected program is run. This is done in the same manner
as in the Dark Avenger virus.
     - The virus has its own critical error handler.
     A few days ago, a young man came to me and said that he
has a new virus, that cannot be stopped by a memory resident
program. Since I received lots of reports for new viruses in
the last month (see the descriptions above) and since most
of the Bulgarian viruses use to circumvent the memory
resident protection programs, I was not very surprised. I
asked him about the main symptoms of the virus - what does
it infect (files/boot sectors), infective length, how does
it show itself (messages displayed, tunes played), does it
contain some strings and so on. He said that the virus
contains a message in which it names itself Murphy. "Oh,
yes," I said, "I already know this one. It's rather common".
"It's impossible that you already know it", replied the
young man, "I created it yesterday and have not released it
yet!"
     It turned out that he spoked about a new version of the
Murphy virus. He was very surprised that an early version of
his virus has escaped and spread all over the country. He
thought a bit, then he said: "Oh, yes, now I remember. A few
months ago all my diskettes were stolen. Between them was
the diskette, containing the virus". Some jerks are *really*
irresponsible!!!
     What to do with such types?! It's impossible to
prosecute them - we do not have the appropriate laws (and
his virus was even not destructive). The old good physical
punishment comes in mind, but I'm against violence. Besides,
he looked so naive - he even didn't realized that his virus
is able to circumvent only the INT 13h monitors. And this
kind of virus writers is the most boring and dangerous one.
With the "genial" virus writers (e.g., the author of the
Number of the Beast) one can at least expect that if he
gives them some interesting work, pays them well and so on,
they will use their skills for something useful instead of
creating viruses. But the "apprentices" like the one I met
are even not skilled enough to create their own virus - they
steal the main ideas form someone else or just modify an
existing virus. They consider creating a virus as some kind
of sport, as a way to proof themselves that they are
SOMETHING...
     Anyway, the new version of the Murphy virus (I call it
Murphy-2) has infective length of 1521 bytes. All the other
properties are the same, except the damage function. Now
every exact hour the virus jumps to the ROM Basic
interpreter - since (as the author of the virus says)
"everyone ought to learn Basic". This may cause loss of
data, if you are editing a large document and have not saved
your changes. Also, the message in the virus has shorten a
bit. Now it reads " It's me - Murphy.  Copywrite (c)1990 by
Lubo & Ian, Sofia, USM Laboratory. " There is also a minor
change in the way the virus checks if it is already present
in memory. Murphy-1 uses function 4B59h and Murphy-2 uses
function 4B4Dh of INT 21h.
     As I already said above, the "USM Laboratory" is
non-existent. "Lubo & Ian" stays for Lubomir Mateev Mateev,
Sofia, ul. "Budapeshta" 14, tel. 80-28-26 and for Iani
Lubomirov Brankov, Mihailovgrad, ul. "G. Damianov" 6, tel.
2-13-34 respectively. At least, these names, addresses and
phones are written in the source listing of Murphy-2, which
I received from one of the authors (Lubomir Mateev, more
exactly).

    10. Last minute update - the V800 virus.
     I was already sending this letter, when a new virus
popped up. I haven't studied it yet. At a first glance, it
has the following properties:
     - The virus infects .COM-files in a rather strange way.
Large parts of them can be found in the virus body and parts
of the virus can be found in the file (before the end of the
original - non-infected - file). It does not infect files
with size less than 1024 bytes. It seems that COMMAND.COM is
never infected (there is a check for 'CO' and 'MM' in the
virus body). Sometimes the virus can attach itself multiple
times to a file. Files grow by 800 bytes after each
infection.
     - Files are infected both when one executes them and
when one copies them.
     - The virus is memory resident. It uses 8 K of memory.
I still cannot figure out why so much memory is needed.
     - The virus is able to fetch the original INT 13h
handler in PC-DOS version 3.30. This is achieved in the same
manner as in the Number of the Beast (512) virus.
     - The virus does not intercept INT 21h. Instead, it
intercepts INT 2Ah, function 82h. This interrupt is called
on every DOS function call, which deals with files.
     - The virus is encrypted. It seems that the encrypted
part does not change from file to file (as the Cascade virus
does), but I'm not sure.
     - When the virus decrypts itself in memory, the string
"Live after Death" appears in its body. I have suspicions
that this virus was also created by the Dark Avenger.
