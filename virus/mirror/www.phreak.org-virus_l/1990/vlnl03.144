VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Re: About Frodo/4K/4096/Stealth/Whatever.... (PC)

As I did the dissection of Frodo (4096) for the Virus Bulletin, I have
examined the virus in some details.  A few comments follow:

	The virus is designed to overwrite the boot sector, but this part
        of the virus does not work in any of the samples I have been able
        to obtain copies of, as the code is garbled and would probably
        cause the computer to "hang".  Don't bee surprized if you hear
        of computers "hanging" on Sept. 22.  I think I know almost how 
	the code looked originally, however the cause of the garbling is
        yet unknown.

        The program written to the boot sector is not a virus.  This is very
        similar to the effect of the GhostBalls virus, which also contains a
        non-infectious program it writes to the boot-sector.  All the
        program does, if it is copied to the boot sector and executed, is to
        display the message FRODO LIVES on the screen, with a moving border
        and disable INT 9 meanwhile, preventing CTRL-ALT-DEL from having any
        effects.
 
        The virus is able to evade some (if not all) interrupt monitoring
        programs, so the best way to stop it is to use a virus-specific
        program like (my own) F-DRIVER or VSHIELD (or was that FSHIELD, I
        never remember which is which).
 
        The reported FAT damage is not real - the virus only confuses CHKDSK,
        which reports FAT damage, as the number of allocated clusters appears
        to be incorrect.  The real damage seems to be done by CHKDSK/F
 
        NEVER, NEVER run CHKDSK/F with Frodo or any other "stealth" virus
        active in memory.  This will cause serious damage, preventing virus
        recovery.

PS: a message to Paul Carapetis.  I apologize for posting a personal
message to the list, but all my efforts to reach him by E-mail have
been unsuccessful, and as I knows he reads comp.virus.....

Message follows: Yes please, I would be very grateful.

   When I read item #1 of this text, I had to reread it to be sure it 
wasn't a misprint.  In this field of Macintosh programming, ethics is a 
problem.  As a group, we have not defined what our ethics are.  There is 
no standard of ethics for the body of Macintosh programmers.  There is no 
ethics committee, no agreed upon guidelines, no process for the review, 
upgrade, and growth of our ethical concept.  As a group, we're big on 
knowledge, but, as a group, we may be short on wisdom.  Maybe that's 
because of our relative youth compared with other professions.  Without 
wise and thoughtful mentors or supervisors for large numbers of Macintosh 
programmers, "ethics" becomes kind of an ad hoc term for whatever values 
or ethics each individual has developed in some other profession, or life 
in general.  There is a pervading sense that if it seems right (to me) 
then it's okay (so I'll do it).  The recent debate about duplicating 
copyrighted software was a beautiful example of this.  Although personal 
values and ethics certainly are related, in this field there is a lot of 
blurring between them, and not a clear understanding by many of how they 
differ.
   Would it be ethical to distribute such code?  I don't know.  Since we 
have no place within our profession to turn for guidance, I, too, must 
draw from outside.  In our culture, and in our law, there is a well 
established principle of "informed consent."  We do conduct physiological 
and psychological experiments whose probable outcome may be unknown.  But 
we regard such experimentation as okay only if the person knows what the 
probable outcomes are, and knows the level of uncertainly, and has the 
capacity to understand these things, and gives consent.  I can imagine 
cases where a user could give informed consent before installing such 
code, but I can also imagine other cases where the writer of the code 
would have no assurance at all that the user understands the implications. 
 Simply displaying text and providing an "OK" button doesn't even meet the 
crudest standards for determining informed consent.  And even if the first 
user gives informed consent, how does the writer determine the informed 
consent of someone else who copies the code from the first?  Here's where 
our profession departs from the medical experiment model.  There's no 
control over the process after interviewing the first user.  So I don't 
know.  I might say "yes" because of ethics developed in my other 
profession, but maybe "no" because THIS profession is different and has 
its own peculariarities.
   What do you think?
P.S.  I agree with Peter's point #2, and don't know about #3.

Subject: Infection of PIF files

Hello,

Recently we have seen a case of a Windows PIF file infected by a virus
(the 4096 to be exact).  This seems to go against what I had been told
about viruses (that they infect excuatables, boot sectors, the FAT and
the partition table of hard disks.) The PIF file does not meet any of
the above conditions so how is the PIF infected by the virus and, more
importantly, how does the infected PIF file infect other files (I
don't see how the PIF lets the virus "go resident"). I notice that
SCAN 66, and some other packages, can be made to check all files so
that an infection of this type should be easy to catch but I would
really like to know the mechanism of infection.  Thanks for any and
all information you can give me!

Does anyone know how I can detect whether there is a virus in the
memory/drives of a Zenith 180 laptop? Scan and Clean are great for my
disks but I am uncertain as to how or if I can use them to check the
memory of my laptop.  Thanks... GDGibson@UB.cc.umich.edu

Subject: Virus names (PC)

It seems to me that we may soon be reaching the point where the number
of virus-infected machines will start to decline, while the number of
new viruses will grow as it has until now, doubling every 10 months or
so.  I don't know if everybody agrees with this, but what I was
actually going to write about now is another subject - the naming of
all the new viruses.

                    How are virus names names selected ?

This is becoming a problem in the PC world, where over 200 different
virus variants are now known. The situation is not quite as bad in the
Mac-world, where only 10 (or so) viruses are known, but this is a
serious problem for anyone reporting a new virus.

The possible methods include:

I - naming by the virus author.  Many viruses contain text strings
within the code, which contain messages like "The Blood virus, version
1.02", or the name may be taken from other text strings within the
virus:

Aids, Aids II, Anarkia, Armagedon, Blood, Brain, Datacrime, Datacrime
II, Disk Killer, Dyslexia, Fu Manchu, GhostBalls, Halloechen, Kennedy,
MIX1, Murphy and Victor Alabama, Amoeba, Amstrad, Sylvia, Form,
Devil's Dance, Stoned, Sunday, Suriv 1.0, Virus-B, Virus-90, Virus-101
and Shake

II - Naming after location where first found:

Agiplan, Durban, Icelandic, IDF, Saratoga, Italian, Itavir, Lehigh,
New Zealand, Pixel, Pretoria, South African, Suomi, Taiwan, Taiwan-2,
Taiwan-3, Vienna

III - name chosen because of some visual or auditory effect:

8 tunes, Ambulance, Cascade, Flip, Ping-Pong, Jo-Jo, Oropax, Yankee
Doodle, Zero Bug, Den Zuk, Frodo

IV - Size of virus:

405, 800, 5120, 1260, 4096

V - Activation date:

Friday the 13th, July 13th, December 24th, June 16th, XA1, Advent

VI - Other actions/characteristics of the virus:

Bulgarian Tiny, Dbase, Do-nothing, Macho, Mistake, Perfume, Slow,
Tenbyte, Tiny, Traceback, Typo, Syslock

VII - no obvious/valid reason for name.

VP, W13, Vcomm

The question is just which method to use - they have all some
advantages and disadvantages.  As the same virus may be assigned
different name by different people, we get situations like the
following:

             Case 1         Case 2
Method I                   suriv/sumsdos
Method II   IDF            Jerusalem
Method III  Frodo          Black Hole
Method IV   4096           1808/1813
Method V    (Sept. 22)     Friday the 13th
Method VI
Method VII                 PLO

Other problems may arise as well.  The Dyslexia virus is an example.
It was originally discovered in Solano County in California and
reported at first as the "Solano" virus.  Later, it was discovered
that the virus contained the string "Dyslexia" in encrypted form, so
another name for the virus is now "Dyslexia".

The question is of course whether text strings found within the virus
should always be used as a "first choice" when naming viruses - Virus
author would probably find it more "fun" to see their creations listed
as "The Mystic virus" or "The Blood Virus", than for example "418" or
"PSQR".

Subject: 12 TRICKS TROJAN

	While I was SCANning my HD I came across a Virus/Trojan.  SCAN
told me it found "12 Tricks Trojan [Tricks] File is compressed with
LZEXE and is infected internally"
	What is the 12 Tricks Trojan and how does it work? How do I
get rid of it?
	The funny thing is the Trojan is contained in one of McAfee's
products called VIRUCIDE V1.2 from Parsons Technology INC.

Glenn J. Andrews

[Ed. I checked with John McAfee on this, who said that SCAN is
identifying the signature data used by VIRUCIDE as the 12 Tricks
Trojan - hence VIRUCIDE apparently does not contain the 12 Tricks
Trojan.  Version 1.4 of VIRUCIDE fixes this problem.  Also, VIRUCIDE
is not one of Mr. McAfee's product, but it does contain the same
signatures used by Mr. McAfee.]

I too fail to see a problem with this.  I think the most important
thing is not whether or not your virus fighting programs are of the
antivirus variety or not, but rather the important questions is did
you get them from a known reliable source (like directly from the
author).

The same argument about beguiling the user could be made against virus
scanning programs.  Such programs are not bad, one must simply be sure
he is getting them from a known source.

I received a report last night about a potentially new virus - a
variant of MDEF. The report originated with Symantec, but I haven't as
yet gotten confirmation. Has anyone else heard of this one?
Symantec's present guidance is:

> SAM 2.0.2B users, set your protection level to Advanced or Custom
> with all the options checked, and when SAM Intercept alerts you
> to an MDEF resource being modified, just choose DENY.
