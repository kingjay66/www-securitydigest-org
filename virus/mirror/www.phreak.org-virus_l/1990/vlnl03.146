Subject: Anti-Viruses, the final chapter (I hope)

	Joe McMahon brings up an excellent point (#3: Bugs). If all
software worked perfectly, every revision level would be 1.0. Having
just gone through a massive installation involving PCs running MS-DOS,
PC-DOS, & Z-DOS in every version from 2.0 to 4.01 (with MANY stops in
between), the likelyhood of an anti-virus program just running on
every platform the first time out are less than nil (Is that a boot
sector infector ? No, it's a Zenith {incidently a 3.0 timestamp is not
in the same place as 3.1 & 3.2 ps: do not rely on VER to tell you
which})- but you would not find out until it was released & then how
do you stop the bad version ?  (I can see it now: Anti-Virus ver 39,
guarenteed to kill 512 viruses including all earlier versions of
Anti-Virus) just send in double the upgrade price for ver 38...).
Enough.

I don't normally read this list, so I didn't see the original posting.
I also thought about this issue about a year ago, with the idea of
writing a virus which attaches checksum verification code to its host.
I came to the same conclusion, (3), that it shouldn't be done, but for
different reasons.  The idea of hunt and kill viruses is cute and
follows along the same idea as biological virus specific vaccines.
Biological organisms are much more complex than computers, and this
approach may be the only means within our technical ability to deal
with a number of viruses.
 
Operating systems, however, we have more control over, and can be made
more secure, by utilizing features of John McAffee's SCAN, SHIELD and
Ross Greenberg's FLUSHOT etc.  With the proliferation of new strains
of viruses occurring at an ever increasing rate, and a number of
mutating strains, some form of data cryptographic verification must be
included in all systems, and the idea of hunter/killer viruses is not
compatible with this approach.
 
Software these days is difficult enough to debug without the effect of
deliberately introduced self modifying code.  The host programs for
these viruses would be infected by the "nice" virus, defeating any
cryptographic verification contained in them also.  There are a large
number of viruses which appear to have been written as harmless
practical jokes, but which have caused data loss through coding
errors.  "Nice" viruses would probably suffer from the same bugs.
 
Signature scanning products such as SCAN are much more useful, as full 
control remains in the hands of the user/system manager.  With several
hundred executable files on my system, I would hate to put up with
numerous viruses requesting permission to infect/disinfect some or all
of the other executables every time I run one.  I would also MUCH
rather rely on as FEW as possible trusted programs to do the 
disinfecting.  Hunter-killers ought to be treated the same way as any
other virus ... get rid of them.

My two cents worth ... standard disclaimers apply (ie it's MY two cents
worth).

Dear netter,

Subject: Trojan viruses

	Well this subject has generated a lot of fruitful discussion.
I based my first point (that antivirus viruses are 'nice') upon
the golden rule, and the need to help out those who don't realize
the need for virus protection, and the need to help ourselves by
keeping the number of Typhoid Mary's out there down.
	But the corollary to the golden rule is: Beware of Greeks
bearing gifts.  By letting people think there ARE nice viruses
we open them to letting down their guard, corruption of their
software and systems, faster (perhaps just slightly) spread of
viruses, modified antivirus viruses, bugs in the antivirus viruses,
and all the rest that you out there have mentioned in the last
week.
	What must we do?  A] 1) Disavow concept of antivirus viruses.
2) Sharply reprimand any author of avv's.  3) Educate that naive
and gullible public out there that avvs are just as bad as viruses.
B] 1) Develop some sort of program to limit and reduce the number
of Typhoid Mary's out there re-introducing viruses. 2) Develop
another program to stop re-introduction of viruses from the
infection pool out there.

Subject: Disinfectant 2.1 (Mac)

Disinfectant 2.1
================

August 18, 1990

Disinfectant 2.1 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.1 recognizes two new viruses which have been discovered in
Ithaca, New York.

The first new virus is a new strain of the MDEF virus (MDEF B).  The
main difference between the old MDEF A strain and the new MDEF B strain
is that the MDEF B strain bypasses the Vaccine protection INIT.

The second new virus is named CDEF.

CDEF is very similar to the WDEF virus. It only infects the invisible
Desktop files used by the Finder. It does not infect applications,
document files, or other system files. It spreads from disk to disk
very rapidly.

Although the behavior of the CDEF virus is similar to that of the WDEF
virus, it is not a simple clone of WDEF. It is a completely different
virus.

The virus does not intentionally try to do any damage. It does not
appear to cause as many problems as does the WDEF virus. As with
all viruses, however, the CDEF virus is still dangerous.

As with the WDEF virus, you can remove a CDEF infection from a disk
by rebuilding the Desktop file.

The CDEF virus is named after the type of resource it uses to infect
files. CDEF resources are a normal part of the Macintosh operating
system, so you should not become alarmed if you see them with ResEdit
or some other tool. Any CDEF resource in a Finder Desktop file, however,
is cause for concern.

Version 2.1 also corrects a few errors in version 2.0, including
incompatibilites with A/UX 2.0, Icon-It!, Spy!, SuperClock, and Rival.
See the "Version History" section of the 2.1 online manual for details.

The Disinfectant sample source code has also been updated to version 2.1.

Disinfectant 2.1 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
acns.nwu.edu [129.105.49.1].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu,
comp.binaries.mac, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet,
America Online, Calvacom, AppleLink, and other popular sources
of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of
free and shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by
sending a self-addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy
disk to the author at the address below. People outside the US
should send an international postal reply coupon instead of US
stamps (available from any post office). Please use sturdy
envelopes, preferably cardboard disk mailers.

There is an additional problem: Many of these 386/486 memory managers
allow you to define "high DOS memory" over the 640k barrier. 386max
for example allows you to load device drivers and TSRs into this
memory region (In my case, it is 96kB at C800 - E000). If a file
infected with a "stealthy" virus into this memory region, I doubt many
scanners will detect it when they look for virus signatures in memory.
To my knowledge, most only scan the "low" 640k.

A friend told me that this has already occured in a number of cases he
knows about.

Subject: SAM's Floppy Scan (Mac)

Recently there was a report of a "loophole" in SAM. The report said
that SAM would not scan floppies if the standard file dialog was
present and a floppy was ejected. This report is not accurate.
 
SAM's floppy scanning mechanism works in this way. If a floppy is
freshly mounted, then SAM will scan it (depending upon the option
selected for scanning). If a floppy is ejected, but NOT unmounted,
then when the floppy is inserted again, SAM will not then rescan it,
since it is not being mounted.
 
This is true whether standard file is present or not. However, when
one ejects a floppy from standard file, standard file does NOT unmount
the floppy. It only ejects it. Hence any floppies which had been
ejected with standard file would not be rescanned by SAM when
reinserted.
 
If some other behaviour is being observed then some other program
(INIT, etc.)  is probably interfering with SAM's scanning mechanism.

Subject: SAM 2.0, CDEF, Garfield (MAC)

For SAM 2.0 Users:
 
Two new Macintosh viruses have been uncovered in the last week or so.
Here is information about them for SAM users.
 
1) A second strain of the Garfield (or MDEF) virus has appeared. It
does not do anything intentionally malicious. It does add MDEF
resources to system files and applications. In advanced or custom
mode, SAM 2 will alert you to this virus's attempt to change and add
MDEF resources. Denying these attempts prevents the resource from
spreading. You can enter one of the following 2 virus definitions with
Virus Clinic to detect this virus by name.
 
To specifically detect this strain of Garfield, enter this definition
(I am repeating the definition previously posted by Karim Esmail of
Symantec here):
 
   Virus Name:   Garfield
 
Resource Type:   MDEF
  Resource ID:   0
Resource Size:   532
Search String:   2F3C4D4445464267487A      (hexadecimal)
Search Offset:   304
 
 
Alternately, you can enter a definition to detect both strains of
Garfield (and delete any earlier Garfield definition you may have
entered). If you choose this option, scans may take slightly longer
(though the difference will probably be unnoticeable), but you will
have entered a definition capable of catching some future Garfield
strains:
 
   Virus Name:   Garfield
 
Resource Type:   MDEF
  Resource ID:   0
Resource Size:   Any
Search String:   A9A92F0CA9AA2F0CA9B0      (hexadecimal)
Search Offset:   Any
 
 
2) A second virus, named CDEF, has also appeared. It also does not do
anything intentionally malicious. It adds CDEF resources to desktop
files only. This virus will NOT spread if SAM 2.0 is running (even in
the Basic level). A feature of SAM 2.0, called Desktop Guardian,
prevents code in desktop files from executing while the Finder is
running. So this CDEF virus will not execute and can thus not spread
while SAM 2.0 is active.
 
If you encounter this virus and you have SAM configured to standard
level or higher, SAM will also alert you to the presence of the CDEF
virus when the desktop file is opened. SAM will give a "Code in
desktop file (CDEF)" alert at that time. By stopping the open of the
infected desktop file, you can cause the Finder to rebuild the desktop
and eliminate the virus.
 
To detect this virus by name, enter the following virus definition in
Virus Clinic:
 
   Virus Name:   CDEF
 
Resource Type:   CDEF
  Resource ID:   1
Resource Size:   510
Search String:   45463F3C0001487A0046A9AB      (hexadecimal)

Subject: RE:virus names

I think that a standard naming convention for naming viruses is the
best idea that I have heard in a long time.  When there were only a
few viruses, it was fine to give each a creative name, but now there
are over 200 and most have several aliases.  Sometimes it's difficult
to be sure exactly which virus someone is talking about.  Standard
names would greatly simplify communication about viruses (like this
list) and identifying new viruses.
   My personal preference would be naming them by size and then an
optional extension to denote variants or special characteristics. An
example is 1704-a, or 4096-stealth.  However any systematic method of
naming would be great.  I think it's an idea which is long overdue.

McAfee has no legal obligation in this case.  His program is "capable"
of modifying files as are many other programs.  The legal onus is upon
the end user to check on licensing agreements that they have accepted
when they bought and commenced using the software.  If the license
agreement explicitly states that the software is not to be modified by
the user in any way, then the user must make the decision as whether
to ignore this in order to provide better protection against
"vandalware".

I would suggest that software manufacturers worth their salt are
currently implementing self-checking facilities for future releases of
software and these companies would be extremely narrow minded to
object to modification of current unchecked versions for this type of
protection.

      Getting prior, informed, consent is fundamental in our culture,
when you're about to mess with someone else's "stuff," whether that
stuff is a posession, a creation, or the person's own body or mind.
   Just think of how arrogant you would have to be to presume to make
choices and "fix" things for another adult without that person's
consent.  Maybe, just maybe, that person would like to try to fix
things on her or his own, before seeking help from someone else.  It
can be pretty degrading to get help that you didn't ask for, and
didn't want, even though the other person thought you needed it.
Maybe pushing uninformed "help" on someone else will lead to a
dependency of that other person on you.  Maybe that would be nice for
*you*, but not so nice for the other person in some cases, and maybe
the underlying motives could be more self serving than altruistic.
   Prior informed consent really is fundamental in our culture.

In many cases ROM shadow is write protected (on my machine for
example) and on the machines of all people I asked. The only way to
check whether it is shadowed or not is timing ROM access and comparing
the timing to RAM timing.

Still, this write protection is software-based only. As I understand
it, these memory managers work by placing the machine in protected
mode and running the PC in Virtual-86 mode. If a virus was able to
switch into protected mode using some backdoor, it becomes feasible to
alter shadowed ROM which would be truly frigthening. Let's hope it
won't happen because we'll have a hard time protecting ourselves
against this type of attack.

What about the dangers from the anti-viruses themselves??

You made an analogy between the wdef virus and a potential deceiving
trojan- horse-like strain of an anti-virus.  Perhaps the analogy could
be better made between the wdef virus and an anti-virus itself.  Like
the wdef virus, an anti-virus would apparently be intended to spread
without causing harm, but in reality would cause an increase in
crashes and therefore data loss.

I don't think "anti-virus" is an appropriate name.  I recommend the
name "virus".  Nobody's saying they think the wdef virus is ok because
it doesn't seem to be intended to do any harm; similarly I don't think
an anti-virus would be acceptable just because of the author's good
intentions.

Yes, the August issue of the Virus Bulletin has an article which comes
to the same conclusion: "If a completely blank floppy disk is infected
with the virus, an uninitialised counter in the routine which searches
through the FAT for free clusters will cause the wrong 3 clusters to
be labelled as bad."
