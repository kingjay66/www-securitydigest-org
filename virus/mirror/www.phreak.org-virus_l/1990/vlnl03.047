VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

By all means do that.  The virus will still write to this file (if
you've allowed your client machines access to it) and will be lurking
there, waiting for you to boot the server from a floppy. When you do
that, the AppleShare Desktop Manager INIT is bypassed and you have a
new source of infection. Also, be warned that rebooting from a floppy
will cause the Desktop file to be *rebuilt* on the server! You will
have to remove it again.

Doubtful. I don't have my handy copy of Inside Mac right here at the
moment, but as I recall, the calling sequences are quite different.  I
believe that there would be trouble (i.e., crash/hang) if you tried
it. However, if the viral WDEF does its infections directly, it might
be able to spread itself before the crash occurs. I don't think that
it would spread as fast as WDEF, because the behavior of the Mac would
take such a sudden turn for the worse that almost anyone would become
suspicious. Also, if you're running GK Aid or Eradicate'em, you're
already protected against anything which looks even remotely
executable in the Desktop file.

Subject: Re: AIDS Copy Prtection System

Ian Farquhar (munnari!mqccsunc.mqcc.mq.oz.au!ifarqhar@uunet.UU.NET)
has posted two notes here recently claiming that the AIDS trojan was a
copy protection scheme.  This has not been a popular idea among
respondents, but they have mostly been addressing themselves to the
immorality of trashing someone's hard disk and the lack of the
promised remedy after "registration".

I think that a more damning feature of the AIDS program is that it
would give the victim some "free" reboots if he would carry it to
another computer and infect it.  While this could be construed by some
(like Mr. Farquhar, no doubt) as being analogous to the incentives
offered by book clubs for enrolling new members (sign up a friend, get
a free book), this to me seems clear evidence that the intent was
malign (as if more evidence is really necessary).  In particular, the
new victims were not necessarily given the benefit of reading the
"license agreement" as the original recipient was.

In any case, Mr. Farquhar is either being intentionally dense to
provoke arguments, or he has some bone to pick with commercial
software vendors that use copy protection and hopes to cast them in a
negative light by associating them with this scam.  I personally don't
see any reason why someone who is clearly responsible for this trojan
wouldn't get convicted, as the overwhelming evidence is that this was
extortion.

Subject: New Virus turns up at U. of Pa! (Mac)

      I think a new MAC virus has turned up here at Penn.  A
co-worker/student gave me a disk with some papers he wanted laser
printed.  When I put the disk into my machine Gatekeeper Aid remove a
WDEF A virus then I got a message saying "GateKeeper found an "Implied
Loader 'INIT'" virus, it has been removed".  I'm glad Gatekeeper Aid
caught it!  I think mention was made of this virus a week ago.  Is
this a new virus??  What does it do??  Is it spread like WDEF A??  I'm
using Gatekeeper Aid 1.0.1.  Will/Can Disinfectant 1.6 catch this
virus.  All these questions....

Subject: Bogus Version of SCANV58 (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
============================================================================

          We have received reports of a SCANV58.ZIP file that contains a bogus
VALIDATE program.  The program is an EXE file (the real validate is a COM
file) and is 46,167 bytes long versus 6,485 for the original VALIDATE.  There
have been reports of system damage from the use of this program and under no
circumstances should it be used.
          The authorized version 58 of scan is 42,977 bytes long, has a
creation date of 2-15-90 and the validation checks should be: Method 1: 2F16
and Method 2: 1C57.
          If you come accross the bogus version and have information about
where it came from, then please contact me at 408 988 3832.  The bogus
validate program appears to be identical to a program uploaded to HomeBase
on 2-19-90 by a person usinmg the name Richard Levey.  The documentation
for the program contained a copyright by Richard Levy, but there was no
phone number or any other contact information provided.
          As you can imagine, we are very anxious to find this person and if
anyone has any information then please call.

   A seperate instance for every possible input?  Nonsense.
All that is required is a seperate instance for every alternative
in a conditional structure.  Of course, that can still require a
large number of instances, and some data will be undefined, so it
would be necessary to rule out entire classes of operations where
it is unacceptable for some parameters to be unknown (such as
direct writes to the disk where the location to be written to is
unknown).  But many such activities would be 'suspicious' anyway.
Another method of verification in which the values of data are
unknown and which requires no seperate instances of a program is
to examine the code as if all alternatives of a conditional structure
are taken.  Once again, it is necessary to rule out certain actions
when data values are unknown.  Remember, however, most instructions
are not suspicious even when all parameters are unknown.  Also, in
conditionals in machine languages there are only two alternatives in
a conditional branch (branch or don't!).  Still, if one tried to simulate
every possible path through any decently large program the number of
instance doublings (every time there is a conditional jump you get two
possible paths) would quickly eat up memory and it would take a *long*
time.  But since it isn't necessary to simulate every possible input,
I think the simulation would terminate within the average user's lifetime.

I sincerely hope that Ian Farguhar is playing devils advocate.  It's
scary to think someone is actually DEFENDING acts of electronic
terrorism.  (Extortion sort of implies you CAN deliver ... you pays
your fee and your club doesn't burn down.  I've seen no evidence that
PC Cyborg could cure/prevent the damage caused by the AIDS disk.)

I haven't seen any information yet on whether or not Australia and
the European countries the AIDS disk showed up in have laws that
protect consumers from unordered merchandise.  I know that US laws
do not apply ... and I know that no one has said they do.  If, however,
similar laws do NOT exist elsewhere, I'd sure be getting on my
legislators case to enact them quickly.  SOMEONE please enlighten us.

Perhaps my economic woes are over.  If there are no laws protecting
Australian citizens from this sort of scam, maybe I can pack up tons
of dog hair and mail it to random addresses in Sydney for use as packing
materials.  Bill at rate of $100 an ounce included ;-).

I have seen this assertion made a half dozen times.  Can somebody
either confirm or deny the report I read in either MacUser or MacWorld
(circa October 1988) that there is malicious code in the SCORES virus
which is only activated by the presence on a disk volume of files
containing certain creator IDs belonging to Electronic Data Systems
(EDS), the company which Ross Perot sold to GM?  I apologize if this
is an old question that has been answered a hundred times already.

So intellectual property may be destroyed by anyone at any time and
the owner has no recourse whatsoever?  If current laws say this, then
it is another failure by those who created our laws to provide adequate
protection of intellectual property.  The parallel with multi-user
systems is flawed, in that in a multi-user system a user *knowingly*
grants the superuser certain privileges in exchange for the system
being efficiently organized, and *with the understanding that the
superuser will *not* abuse those privileges*!

   What the AIDS program did was most likely illegal, but what's even
more important, it was entirely unethical.  As to the response here,
all I've seen are warnings not to run the program (in light of what it
does), and perhaps there was some advice on how to recover files that
the program took hostage.  Telling people how to recover their legal
property is hardly wrong.  What I haven't seen are instructions on how
to run the AIDS program despite its "copy protection", which would
violate the rights of the author.

   Creating disassembled listings of the program would, unfortunately,
violate the author's right to create derivative works, but I see this
as a necessary evil in the highly ethical process of attempting to
restore the legal property of victims of this program.

Fine, but you'd have to show that the jury members had read the articles.

At present, of course, the only way is to keep a backup of the operating
system release diskettes, and to pray that the makers of the OS are not
infected.  I hope the major (and minor, for that matter) OS publishers
use the very newest and best virus protection softward available.
If they don't, then God help us!  Perhaps the virus protection people

Subject: Israeli virus strains vs. Novell? (PC)

Good evening,

recently, a user of a Novell Network consulted me about my (ancient,
even obnsolete, yet popular) VIRCHECK program, which had rendered his
network hanging.  He declared, that Novell uses Int 21, Function E0,
for its internal gearings -- the very same function the "Friday 13th"
virus uses for its signalling.  My VIRCHECK will check for the
presence of TSR "Friday 13th" by invoking this function and looking at
the answer.

Now I conjecture, that
** the "Friday 13th" will cause Novell Networks to hang every time an
   infected program is invoked;
** so will probably other Israeli strains do (Y.R. forgive me: I don't
   know any other, widely recognized, term for them :-) ;
** IMMUNE and similar virus-watchers will probably suspect Novell
   of being a virus, and alert the user about it;
** VIRCHECK and similar virus-checkers will cause Novell to hang,
   as well.

Has anybody any experiences to share with us, in this respect?
(I, for my part, have no Novell running to test my conjectures.)

Subject: US H.R. 55


This may be a rehash of an old topic and if it is, I apologize at
the start.  The FOLLOWING VIEWS ARE IN NO WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO
ANYONE OTHER THAN ME.

- ----------

Does anyone know what the status of US H.R. 55 is?  H.R. 55
introduced in July of 89, is a follow-up to the 1986 Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act.  It addresses, in part,  computer virus designed
with "authorized " assess to computers, or viruses that are not
designed to delete files.  According to Rep Wally Herger (R-Calif)
this bill was supported by a number of computer lobbying groups.


What concerns me most was that it was reported that H.R. 55
establishes tough penalties(up to 20 years in prison) for;

     "knowingly" planing a virus that causes "loss, expense,
     or risk to the health or welfare" of an individual or a
     company.

This would seem to open the provider/installer of any software at
risk of libel.  Software has bugs, like it or not.  (Also remember
that in layman's vernacular the common cold is caused by a
bug/virus without much distinction) If the presence of a "bug"
results in a "potential" risk to the health or welfare(?) of an
(individual or) company you as the provider/installer could find
yourself facing 20 years in jail.  If this is the case, the
liability insurance problem faced by the medical profession will
be nothing compared to what the software industry will face.

With the way the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) has been used in civil court, it is very
hard to bank on "intention of congress" when it comes to the way
a law will be applied.

RICO was designed as a weapon to protect legitimate business from
organized crime.  But civil claims have been filed under it in
cases of bank fore-closures on real estate, between doctors and
hospitals over staff privileges, to cases between warring spouses
in divorce cases and child custody battles.

The parallels for misuse of the provisions of H.R. 55 seem too
obvious.

     You have just converted your companies market information
     system to a new Relational Database product that contains
     a bug. Because of that bug you are unable to retrieve key
     marketing information and as a result the "well being"
     (market position) of your company is now "at risk."

Will this be grounds for prosecution or a civil suit?  Before you
answer, consider the RICO situation.

When RICO was enacted it was mostly ignored, as was the 1986
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act until the Morris case). But around
1980, plaintiffs' lawyer started seeing the potential for applying
RICO to individuals other than typical racketeers.  The number of
civil RICO cases increased eightfold for the early 1970s to the mid
sixties.

The increased cost for defending against litigation brought under
RICO and the costs of higher insurance premiums end up coming out
of the consumers pocket.  If the same situation develops as a
result of law based on H.R. 55 the impacts could be felt in almost
every sector of the economy.

But then for those brave soles who are still willing to face the
risks of the lawyers, writing software may become a vveerryy well
paying profession.

Subject: VALIDATE.EXE (PC)

Last night someone upload scanv58.zip to my bbs which contained a
different version of validate by another author.

The program clearly states the author's name and the documentation
clearly indicates it was not written by McAfee and Associates.

I carefully unzipped the files and checked them all for virus and/or
trojan infections. THERE WERE NO VIRUS REPORTED!

Just to be safe, I used SOURCER to check VALIDATE and there were
NO suspicious or dangerous routines in the program. It does exactly
what it claims to do, that is it opens a file, reads the file a
block at a time, and generates four CRC's for the file.

I ran it and it runs fine. Absolutely no problem whatsoever!In fact
it seems to be slightly faster than McAfee's validate.com and it
generates four CRC's instead of two.In the documentation the author
claims to use proprietary forumlas for generating the CRC's.

Today, I get a message in VALERT about this program. According to
Mr. McAfee, it is bogus and supposedly damaging systems. Nothing could
be further from the truth! The VALIDATE.EXE does one thing which it
is obvious Mr. McAfee does not like. That is (in my opinion) that
it leaves his version of validate in the dust.

Mr. McAfee negelected to mention that in the documentation it appears
there is a question as to who owns the rights to the name VALIDATE.
I called HOMEBASE and downloaded the real scanv58 and with the
exception of the different validate.doc and validate.com found
the other files to be exactly IDENTICAL. This being the case it seems
to me that Mr. McAfee is complaining over nothing. The version of
SCAN is correct and is not damaged or changed in any way.

It seems to me that the author just deleted Mr. McAfee's version of
validate and included his own in the archive file. It appears no changes
were made to SCAN and as such I don't see what McAfee is complaining
about, unless he is attempting to claim a copyright on the contents
and/or makeup of the scanv58 archive file?

The only thing bogus about this whole matter is the fact that McAfee
sent out a VALERT notice about it. Especially since he claims that
validate was uploaded to HOMEBASE several days ago and he had plenty
of time (so it appears) to make comments before this.

In my opinion the author of validate has done the community a favor
by replacing the program in the archive file with one that appears
to do a better job.

As far as the program names are concerned, so what? I checked over
five different copies of McAfees validate and none of them mention
that he has a trademark on the name validate. The validate.exe does
have a trademark notice,      and as such that should be the one
and only program to use the name validate.

If mcafee can provide absolute proof that validate.exe damages
systems as he claimed in valert, let him do so by producing the
source code to prove his claim. As I mentioned earlier SOURCER
was used to disassemble the validate.exe and there is no evidence
of any code which could damage a system. In fact the only code
which accesses the disk opens the file for READ and then closes
it at the end of the program. The only memory accesses appear to
be a large numeric array set up to read the file into and the code
which reads the array and generates the CRC's. There is nothing
dangerous in this program whatsoever (in my opinion).

I also read the documentation and the alleged author's name is
clearly there, as well as complete information on the validate.exe
program. It appears to be a shareware program and clearly states
this when you run the program.

Due to the differences in the disassembly between the two versions
of validate, they are obviously written in two different languages.
IN other words VALIDATE.EXE appears to be a totally different program
from validate.com. It does not appear to be a hack of mcafee's version
it appears to be a totally different program.

As such I for one will continue to use the new version of validate,
and thank the author for supplying it in a rather unorthodox manner.
I also feel that Mr. McAfee was in my opinion wrong in using valert
to knock a another's product without justification. VALERT is ONLY
supposed to be used (as I read the instructions) to notify the
community of a trojan or a virus. Nothing, repeat nothing in the
scanv58 archive file I received meets that criteria! His scan
program was not modified or changed in any way, shape or form!
If every author launched a valert notice every time an archive
file had files added or deleted all we would ever read would be
valert notices.
