Hi,

     Ben Smith had an idea to monitor actions taken by programs
and compare those actions with what the vendor says the program needs
to do in order to function.

     I hate to shoot this down but consider this hypothetical case:

"PC-DOS V8.0" includes a security monitor with a list of privileges
for "Norton Super Utilities V6".  This list has "modify memory" and
"write boot sector" listed for Norton.

     Now suppose that a virus instead of trying to modify the boot
sector by itself, modifies Norton Disk Doctor to do the dirty work?
The monitor program would allow the Disk Doctor full access to the
boot sector and not know that it was really a corrupted Disk Doctor
actually writing viral code to the boot sector instead of making
repairs like the Disk Doctor normally does.

     My point is that even if a program is allowed to perform some
action, how is the monitor supposed to know whether that action is
legitimate or not?

A human being may or may not be a finite state machine, but the
effect he he has on a computer system is merely to add a finite
number of transitions to the computer. (Striking one of the finite
number of keys changes the interrupt state on a PC, putting in
a new disk changes many of the bits on that mass storage device).

You can't model exactly which inputs the human will provide, but
you can reason about behavior under any possible set of inputs.
In effect, a person at a computer is running a huge finite
automata through an input string consisting of his actions.

Take the initial state to be one of the finite number of
states which represents the introduction of the virus into
the system.  Mark the finite number of states which represent
"infection" as final states.  The question: "can infection occur"
is merely the question "does this FA have a nonempty language."
That question can be settled in finite time by testing the FA
on every input string of length less than or equal to the number
of states in the FA.  Do this once for every initial "infection"
state, and the result follows. :-)

You may need to add a few more states to better model
the input devices and the clock.

Yep.

    I tried using M-Jruslm on a .exe file.  After it was finally done
disinfecting the file it would no longer work.  When trying to run the
.exe file my machine froze.  I have downloaded CLEANP57 and tried
running it but have been unsucessful.  I'm following the directions
that come with the program but I'm still having problems.  I'm typing
the following:

                 CLEAN A:\FILE.EXE [JERUSALEM B]

When I try it this way I get "Sorry I don't know anything about
[Jerusalem B].

When I try:

                CLEAN A:\FILE.EXE JERUSALEM B

it comes back with the instructions again.  Nothing happens.  I know
I'm not using this correctly.  Can anybody help with the proper
syntax.  When it asks for the "virus name", what do I type in for
Jerusalem B.  Do I use the [] brackets.  Do I have the correct
version.  I am running CLEAN 2.7V57.  When I run it, I do get a
message saying "This program may not be used in a business,
corporation, organization, government or agency environment without a
negotiated site license."  I'm not sure if this is the problem or not.
If I have a bad version, where could I get the correct one.  I've
tried getting onto Simtel but either cannot its very busy or I end up
downloading unusable or corrupted files.  I got this from the
"130.160.20.80" list.  Does anybody know of others I can use??  I'm
new to all this so please bear with me.  Thanks for any assistance.  I
really want to get rid of this virus.

Subject: Re: The Ultimate Anti-Viral Solution?

Well, the idea of programs containing descriptions of their own
activity is nice, but doesn't really solve the problem.  After
all, all an infecting virus has to do is change these permission
files.  Or better yet, the virus could patch the code that did
these checks so that the code would let this particular virus
go through.  If we think about how current virus detection programs
"work", they basically do exactly what you described (only, instead
of each manufacturing describing the program's behaviour, the burden
is on the user).  Take SAM, for instance, which can keep track of
legal and illegal activities on an application-by-application basis.
When it detects illegal activity, it brings up a dialog box that says
"Allow"  "Deny" and "Learn" (or three similar options).  Clicking on
"Learn" will change SAM's description of that program to allow that
potentially-illegal action in the future.  Now, that information is
stored in SAM somewhere, where any moderately clever virus could
find it and modify it.  Now, let's go one one step further and pretend
that Symantech made it impossible (via some yet-undiscovered hardware
scheme) for SAM to be modified.  Now our virus would be forced to
use the following piece of pseudo-code:

Step 1:  Set the window-manager's port 16,000 pixels to the left
Step 2:  Set up dialog-box sniffer code that works at _vblank time.
Step 3:  Do illegal virus activity
Step 4:  SAM brings up its dialog box, which now appears about 16
         feet off the screen due to step 1.
Step 5:  The dialog sniffer from step 2 "sees" the dialog and
         generates a mouse-down event over the "Learn" button.
Step 6:  SAM writes the new exception to its special harware
Step 7:  Restore the window-manager's port to its old position.

We have now successfully infected, despite all of super-SAM's
harware whatever.

Let's face it.  There is NO WAY WHATSOEVER to make a computer
virus-proof, because there is no way that a computer can
determine the true intentions of a piece of code.  (which, in tern,
is due to the fact that code doesn't HAVE intentions, only the
programmer who wrote it has intentions, and guess what?  They
don't make it through the compile! :-)

We should concentrate our efforts on education, not complex software
solutions.  After all, computer virii seem more a social problem
than a technological one.

Subject: Virus detection through change detection / authorization

When we try to evaluate schemes for detecting and preventing
the spread of viruses, it's important to remember that a virus
uses those operations a user normally does to spread. If a
virus only infects programs when you do something to modify
an executable program, you now have to determine that the
modification that was made was the one you desired. That's
a correctness problem, which we know is undecidable.

Determining what's executable, on modern day systems, is
also a very hard problem. Any systems that have shell
languages, or interpreters complicate this task immeasurably.
What does a shell script look like? A text file. What does
a hyper-text stack look like? While the current generation
of micro-computer viruses live mostly in program images,
there is no requirement that this be true in the future.

We can slow down the spread of viruses through lots of
different mechanisms, but each of these mechanisms reduces
the utility of computers. As long as we want our computers
to be general purpose machines, with lots of flexibility,
the virus writers will be able to exploit a programs legitimate
capabilities to spread viruses. Distinguishing between normal,
legitimate, change and illicit change is a very difficult problem.

Last week, I downloaded "CLEAN UP" from Simtel, which claims to cure many

to offer deleting the infected file. I don't want to be rude, but what's
wrong with the good old DOS ">DEL file.ext" ?. Why to bother writing code

I've been having some problems with some PC's at the college where I teach.
The evidence points to a virus.  Someone from IBM ran a virus scanner on
a couple PC's and got the following message:

Not true. What constitutes an "executable file"? Is a BASIC program one?
You can write a virus in BASIC. How about Postscript? You can hide a
virus in Postscript. You can't turn off your BASIC or Postscript
interpreters...

This is the basic sort of protection used by old Burroughs computers: only
the compilers could create executable files, and they were trusted programs.
They had no memory protection hardware at all.

The two cases are not equivalent. Smallpox doesn't have a non-human
vector.  Polio does... in fact I believe that stagnant water can serve
as a reservior for Polio. So we can't "eradicate" Polio the way we

    I've seen this coming ever since the GK-Aid INIT was released- but
    then again, I anticipated WDEF in a message about seven months ago,
    and all of this revolves around one concept- file signatures that look
    like code, and vice versa (I can't claim any great genius on this,
    though- I got the idea from seeing C. Weber's FKEY Manager program
    cause crashes on Cmd-Shift-0... anyone else remember that?).

    To answer your questions (as best as I can from your description), the
    Adobe Separator utility has a file signature which happens to have the
    exact same four bytes as a type of executable resource that lives in
    the system file.  Now while I've never seen the GateKeeper-Aid, I'm
    pretty certain I know exactly what it does- it prevents any resource
    which looks like executable code to the Mac OS from going into the Mac
    desktop. This is a well-defined list which includes (not surprisingly)
    WDEF.

    So what happened was, when Separator was put on your hard disk, you
    didn't have GK-Aid, and so the Separator bundle (signature ADBS) was
    added to your desktop (as it should have been). When you tried to open
    the folder containing Separator for the first time, on your other
    disk, you were running GK-Aid.  At that point, the Finder wanted to
    add the bundle resource 'ADBS' to the second disk's Desktop file, and
    GateKeeper vetoed it.

    In summary, everything is OK (as long as I'm right that Separator's
    signature is 'ADBS'). GK and the Finder are both behaving as they
    should. The folks at Adobe get the programming-fools-of-the-week award
    for picking such a bad signature. Nothing to shoot them over, though.

    If you just override GK long enough for the signature to get into the
    desktop file, it will stop bothering you (the Finder only adds a
    bundle once).

Hope this helps (and I _really_ hope it's right)--

DISCLAIMER: IF A NEW VIRUS TRASHES YOUR DISK, DON'T BLAME ME.

Subject: Universal virus detectors: Once more with feeling

David Chess continues, in essense, to complain about the user
interface.  He says that determining which changes to executables were
deliberate and which not is too hard, etc.  This again misses my
point.  I was not trying to sell anyone on a "solution to the virus
problem".  I was trying to point out that the apparent THEORETICAL
impediments to virus DETECTION were in no sense basic, but were
side-effects of the particular ways we have chosen to build our
hardware and our mathematical models.  We can make other choices if we
wish.

He also asks:

        Or it could create the object that it wanted, and call the copy
        utility.  Or is it impossible for a program to copy a non-executable
        thing to an executable thing?  That would help a little, but would
        also make the system less convenient to use.  How do you get a new
        copy of the linker?  How do you write a patch program?

No, on such a system you could not copy a non-executable thing to an
executable, unless you chose to have a copy routine which was marked
"may set the 'executable' bit".  Most people do not need patch
programs - most people are not programmers.  Those who need a patch
program can give it the appropriate rights.  You create a new linker
by linking one with the old one, if you are in the business of
creating new linkers.  Or you install one, already marked as
executable, from a binary disk you got from a trusted source.

Russell Wallace has two complaints: That this technique only catches
viruses at run-time, rather than by examining the code, and that
various things he does on his Amiga, like patching code, would become
impossible.  For the first, I suggest that *I* examine code by running
it on my CPU - it's much better at looking closely at things than I
am.  Today, that's a dangerous thing to do, since the act of
examination may let a virus do damage.  On a properly built system, I
would be told if the code tried to do anything to any of my
executables.

As for patching and such: The machines I described are perfectly
capable of doing anything any current machine can do.  If you give a
patch program the right to create executable code, it will work just
as it does today.  Of course, in the process you give up some of your
protection.  Hey, if you release the safety on a gun, you could
accidentally shoot yourself.  Imagine that!

Arthur Larky writes: "Perhaps I'm Missing Something" and points out
that an MS/DOS timestamp is worthless.  Yes, he did miss something -
my article which talked about where these timestamps come from.
Sorry, not from MS/DOS or any existing software or hardware....

He also says:

        But that's what I do for a living: "program development, install new
        executables, etc."  Oh, well, one can always retire to something less
        challenging such as urban warfare.

Welcome to the real world.  Only a minority of us do program
development, a minority that is growing smaller every day.  While most
owners of PC's have to install executables, that involves a minute
fraction of the time they spend using their systems.  If a system
protected them, it would be well worth building.  As to the developers
- - they are inherently doing something riskier, and will have to watch
their systems more carefully.  With the "no new executables" switch
off, they can develop - and be infected - as always.  They still get
the hardware modification log if they want it.

        I translate this to mean "find something other than a PC or a MAC on
        which to do your computing."  True, but it doesn't solve the current
        problem for most of us.

You bet.  But, to repeat myself, I wasn't TRYING to solve anyone's
current problems - I was trying to show that a solution is POSSIBLE,
if we decide it is worth the costs.  The problems involved are
monetary/political/organizational, NOT technical.

Subject: AIDS Virus Suspect Arrested Near Cleveland, Ohio

                         COMPUTER BLACKMAIL ALLEGED
                  Lake [County] man held on British counts

For  those of you  who don't find  the Cleveland Plain  Dealer on your
doorstep or bushes each morning ----

>From Page 1 of The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, OH, Saturday, February 3
By META McMILLAN, Staff Writer

"  A Willowick man  is being held without  bond on a federal  fugitive
warrant, pending   extradition  to England  to  face    blackmail  and
extortion  charges in connection with a   computer disk that scrambled
and stymied computer systems across Europe and Africa.

Joseph L.  Popp Jr., 39, of W.  Willowick Dr., was brought before U.S.
Magistrate Joseph    W.  Bartunek  yesterday morning,   complaining of
mental illness, to face charges that the disk he allegedly created and
mailed to  as many as 26,000 businesses  and hospitals  was part of an
elaborate blackmail scheme.

Authorities in England  are seeking to extradite  Popp under the terms
of a 1972 treaty with the United States.

Bartunek delayed the extradition hearing until after he can review two
psychiatric  evaluations  of   Popp.    The magistrate   ordered   the
examinations  --- one by a  court-appointed psychiatrist and the other
by Popp's doctor --- after Popp's lawyer told the judge his client was
suffering from mental illness and was on medication.

Bartunek  said he expected the  psychiatric  reports   to be available
within  10 days, after  which he will determine  whether  a competency
hearing is needed before an extradition hearing is scheduled.

Popp  was arrested   Thursday  without  incident  by FBI   agents  and
Willowick police at the home he shared with is parents.  A warrant for
his arrest was issued Jan.  18 by a London  magistrate.  A sealed U.S.
warrant was issued Jan.  24 by U.S. District Judge Ann Aldrich.

Scotland Yard charges that about Dec. 11, while he was in London, Popp
mailed  20,000  to  26,000  IBM  data  disks to  hospitals,  insurance
companies and major corporations.

The disks purportedly  provided information on  what individuals could
do  to reduce their  chances  of  catching acquired immune  deficiency
syndrome.

After some   computers became infected  by  the  program,  word of the
potentially destructive disks spread within days, and  AIDS researches
in the United States were put on alert.

Companies  in African nations,  England, Belgium, Denmark, Holland and
Australia received the  disks, London  officials said.   Investigators
believe no disks were mailed to the United States or Canada.

The packages containing the  disks bore a  printed warning  that users
would be billed up to $378 for use of  the disk.  Payments  were to be
sent to PC Cyborg Corp., whose address is a post office box in Panama.

Gary Arbeznik,  an     assistant  U.S.  attorney,  said  that   London
authorities had told  U.S. investigators that "when  the disk was used
in a  computer, an  AIDS  program was generated.  At   the end of that
program, the screen would go blank, except for  an invoice, which said
"if you wish to  use this computer,"  up to  $378  must be paid  to an
address in Panama.

"When the money was  paid, an antidote  would be sent," Arbeznik said,
"Until then, the machine was unusable."

Popp is believed to have used the mailing list from PC Business World,
a London computer publication, to target recipients of the disks.

Officials of PC  BUsiness World  said  a  man  identifying  himself as
"Ketema," an African businessman, contacted the magazine's circulation
department in October about purchasing part of  its mailing  list.  He
paid more than $1,000 for 7,000 names, the magazine said.  About 1,200
of those  PC  users were hit with  the virus; the  rest were warned in
time, said senior reporter Mark Hamilton.

PC Business World said Cyborg also used other mailing lists.

Cyborg's directors are listed  as  Kitain  Mekonen, Asrat Wakjira  and
Fantu Mekease.

The suit for  extradition  said  Popp  began planning the   scheme  in
February 1989, when he set up the Panama firm.  FBI spokesman Bob Hawk
said the bureau had information that Popp was  prepared to mail out an
additional 2 million disks.

Popp, soft-spoken with dark hair and flecks of gray in his dark beard,
was  handcuffed as he appeared  in  the  courtroom.  He was dressed in
loafers, faded blue jeans and  a multicolored   sweater.  His eyes  at
time darted anxiously toward the few spectators in the courtroom.

He was  rushed in  and out  of   the federal courtroom    through back
entrances.

Popp   is a  zoologist and  anthropologist  who has conducted   animal
behavior research for several international health agencies, including
UNICEF   and  the World Health  ORganization.   He  said  he was under
psychiatric  care and taking medication  for a  mental illness.  Twice
during  the  morning  hearing,   he  said   he was  not  clear   about
proceedings.

Bartunek ordered the courtroom cleared  so Popp could consult with his
lawyer, John Kilroy,  who practices  in Euclid   [Ohio].  The  meeting
lasted  several minutes, after  which Bartunek again apprised Popp  of
the charges.

Popp  said he  understood  what  they  involved   but added  "I do not
understand how  it applies to  my  case."  Kilroy unsuccessfully asked
that Popp be held in a psychiatric hospital rather than in jail.

Kilroy described Popp,   and  Ohio  State  University graduate  [1972,
biological science]  with a  doctorate  in anthropology from   Harvard
University  [1979],  as  a  respected  anthropologist  being  unfairly
painted as a criminal.

Popp  left  the World Health Organization,  a  special agency  of  the
United  Nations,  a  few weeks before  Christmas  and returned  to his
parents' home, Kilroy said.

Popp received no money  in his  endeavor to  market the   flawed disk,
Kilroy said, but  had hoped  to generate money  to conduct research on
the AIDS virus.

Kilroy  said  he did  not have  enough information  to explain why the
disks apparently had shut down computer  systems across two continents
and in some cases destroyed the information those systems contained.

He   said he had  had only  two brief  interviews with Popp  since his
arrest.

John Austen, an investigator with  the computer crimes division of New
Scotland Yard, said  Popp's actions were  motivated  by money and that
Popp could face up to 10 years in prison for  each count of blackmail.
He declined comment on whether investigators believe Popp acted alone,
but  a    recent article in  the  Times   of London referred     to an
investigation seeking four men in connection with the virus.

Popp was moved  after the hearing to  an undisclosed jail.    Bartunek
told Kilroy to  make a  list of medications  Popp  required so federal
marshals could  ensure that he  received them.  Popp has complained to
Bartunek  that  while  he was held at the  Lake  County Jail after his
arrest Thursday, he as not given proper medication.

"I am deeply disturbed at  times,"  he told Bartunek, "and  one day in
custody  ... can be  a day of disorientation."  "   Staff writers Eric
Stringfellow and Rebecca Yerak contributed to this article.  "

possible computer virus was held without bail while a judge considered
reports on his sanity, authorities said today."
  "Joseph Popp, 39, appeared before a U. S. magistrate to face charges
