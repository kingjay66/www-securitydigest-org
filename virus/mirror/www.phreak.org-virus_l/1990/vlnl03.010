VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Hi. Hope this is relevant to this list ...

We've discoved that the driver diskette shipped with a Wise Data Systems
PC is infected with the STONED virus. The system has a tgva VGA card and
OAK software on a Wise 386/25

Both shrinkwrapped and downloaded software sources have their
advantages and risks of contamination.  It is our belief that the
important factor is not the distribution method by which you acquire
your software which will protect you, but the integrity of your
sources.  While there have been some very serious and regrettable
instances of viruses appearing in both shrink-wrapped and downloaded
software, these are rare in comparison to the viral propagation that
results from software that is "passed around."

To achieve maximum protection you should (a) acquire software only
from trusted sources, (b) scan and monitor your system for viral
activity regularly, and (c) backup often and systematically.

Subject: Desktop Fractal Design System Virus (PC)

As one of the "mugs" (probably translates as "schmuck" stateside?) who
ran the Desktop Fractal Design System as soon as it arrived, can I ask
any genius out there who works out how to get rid of it to contact me
pronto?

However I have checked the size of my .EXE files against copies on other
machines and I get identical results, plus VIRUS SCAN does not detect
any infection. Could it be that not all the disks were infected, or
only those distributed in the USA?

Subject: 1812 Virus (PC)

Earlier today we found out that SHRINK-WRAPPED software called The
Desktop Fractal Design System by Michael F. Barnsley, Iterated
Systems, Inc. (1989) is infected with a virus.  The program is sold
through Academic Press and they are aware of the problem.  VIRSCAN
(the IBM product) identified it as the 1813 virus.  Seems the EXE and
COM files run since the offending software was loaded were all
clobbered and their filesizes grew exponentially every time they were
loaded.  Interestingly enough, none of the network files were
affected.  Was it was pure luck or that the file attributes on the
network COM & EXE files were set to READ ONLY?  Oh, where's the
aspirin !?  Anyway, could somebody do a quick review of the atrocities
which will befall us with the 1813 virus? Thanks.

Now that the dust has settled a bit, does anyone know how much damage
was really done by the AIDS trojan?  Also, has anyone come up with a
good explanation of why it was released in the first place?

I think this is VERY dangerous.  How do you define what an
"executable" file is?  How about a Hypercard Stack?  It is quite
possible for a document to have a legal "executable" resource, and any
false positive is going to result in the trashing of someone's data.

A problem that may show up with shrink warped (sic) software is that sometimes
retailers will take back software from customers, and re-shrink warp it, at the
store.  If the customer tried the software out on an infected machine....
