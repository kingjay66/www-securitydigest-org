That's not true for all machines. Nearly all, if not all of the more
recent support chip sets for PCs (both 286 and 386) allow BIOS
shadowing (and Video BIOS shadowing, as well) in _hardware_,
regardless of what mode the CPU is running in. Some of these chip sets
can be manipulated to allow write access to the 0xF0000 area (after
all, the boot-up code needs write access to copy the code over). Some
others, however, have various interlocks that disallow write access
after the initial copy, or from any executing code outside the BIOS.

I have to disagree.  You have absolutely no right to mess with my
computer or any of its contents, no matter what your intentions.  Who
are you to decide what strings of bytes I may or may not have in my
personal machine?  What right do you, a well-meaning (?) programmer
have to affect my personal property?

If I am walking along down the street and notice that your car's
leaking break fluid, I might leave a note on the windshield, but I
certainly wouldn't jack up your car and fix the problem.  That is your
responsibility.  I can educate you, warn you - but I can't keep you
from making mistakes.

Another point is that you are killing these viruses with a virus!
Look at what you're proposing!  You decide what piece of code may roam
unchecked in my machine and what piece of code may not?!  I'm sorry,
but I don't know you well enough to support such a dangerous idea.  

I feel that those who have learned to protect themselves are fairly
safe from virus attacks by being careful and using available
virus-detectors.  As for those ignorant enough or foolish enough to go
without protection ... they'll learn eventually.  Education is the
key, not forced action.  (Wait a second, shouldn't this last paragraph
have been posted to alt.sex instead?! :-)

Does the number "7106286813" look familiar to anybody ?  It is found
inside the Bulgarian "1024" virus, but does not seem to have any
obvious purpose.  A Bulgarian identification number maybe - perhaps a
date + something else - any Bulgarian programmer born on 7-10-62 ?
:-)

At least this is not a phone number.....  :-)

Does the text "Sudah ada vaksin" mean anything in any language ?  It
looks like Arabic to me.  This text is found inside the French "Mardi
Bros" virus.

I believe I asked about this before - there are some mysterious
messages inside the JOCKER.EXE program (which may or may not be a
virus)

Does anyone have any useful information on the AntiCad virus.
Accorrding to the list by Patricia Hoffman, "AntiCad" is just an alias
for the V-1 virus, but I have received a virus from Dr. Alan Solomon,
which is named ANTICAD.EXE and is clearly something entirely
different.

This virus is 10005 byte long, seems to contain bits and pieces from
the Jerusalem virus - possibly even multiple copies of it, and is not
at all related to the V-1 virus.

Any information on the origin of the "AntiCad" name would be appreciated.

Subject: Reduced risk

I don't know if everybody agrees with me, but it seems to me that the
risk of a virus infection these days may be lower than it was a year
ago.  The main reason being increased awareness of viruses as well as
increased availability of anti-virus software.

The number of reported viruses continues to grow, doubling every 10
months or so, but the percentage of infected computers may actually be
declining.  At least it is here in Iceland, but I am not sure if this
observation holds for the rest of the world.

Another interesting phenomena is the extinction of various viruses.
Many of the 250 or so known PC viruses are extinct or on their way to
extinction.  The Brain virus is an example of this - it was one of the
most common viruses for a while, but is now becoming quite rare in
many countries.

Subject: Origin of screen effect code in the JOJO virus.

     The screen effect code in the JOJO virus appears to come from the
program DAZZLER.ASM which was listed in the "User-to-User" section of
PC Magazine (Nov.  24, 1987; pages 386-388).  It was also one of the
programs included with the book PC Power Tools, published in June
1988.  The code in the virus is virtually identical, with at most a
tiny number of changes.

     In particular, it is very likely that any virus scanner using the
screen effect code as its signature string will give a false positive
indication on the program DAZZLER.COM.

You mean the known risks and benifits. More will inevitably surface
when the treatment is used widely. In any case, this just amounts to
knowing that the Salk Vaccine can cause paralytic disease and death -
but not too often.  See my discusion of bugs in live vaccines.

Wrong! The Salk vaccine is CONTAGIOUS. It automatically administers
itself without anyones consent or even knowledge. There is no consent
and no one is informed.

There is a big difference. The vaccine is less distructive. No one
would use this type of approach against a relatively harmless virus
like WDEF, for example. It may be no diferent to your mind but it
would surely be different from point of view of the guy whose disk
didn't get wiped.

Note that the use of a live vaccine does not require anyone to lower
his guard.

Most (computer) viruses will not infect the same file more than once.
If they did they would swamp the system and distroy their chances of
spreading. Because of this different strains of the same virus will
compete (as long as one virus recognizes the other as self).

It is also posible to use an "immune" mechanism. Replace the "disk
muncher" payload with an add for anti-viral software (It would be sure
to get instant attention! Sort of like an AIDS vacine that changes
people's behavior - by turning them purple.) ... Just a momment ...
I'm not sure I like the direction this chain of thought is leading!

Disk boot failure ?
Moshe vainer had just described the phenomena of reviving a dead disk.
Well, a friend of mine just bought a used disk, and after a week use it
started reporting read/write errors and fill itself with bad sectoers.
The disk went to repair and was found fully operational, but under
severe Viral attack... The virus was identified as PingPong, but I
doubdt it, since the PingPong doesn't cause SUCH trouble. Since both
cases happened in Israel : the one diskette land, the homeland of
Viruses... Maybe, Just maybe, we are encountering a new, unknown, virus
???
Good luck !      Shahar.

Bzzzzt!  Bad analogy.  The Salk vaccine is under fire for multiple reasons:

	1) It has definitely been the CAUSE of cases of polio.
	   Not a large percentage of the population, to be sure.

	2) The concept of the vaccine spreading by 'contagious' means
	   has been called into serious doubt.

	3) There are much safer DEAD vaccines now, which have been in
	   use in Europe for many years now that have absolutely NO
	   cases of CAUSING a case of polio, that are cheaper to make,
	   and easier to administer.

The Salk vaccine is a much closer parallel with the best reasons for
NOT having anti-virus viruses:

	1) An Anti-virus virus COULD cause damage by infecting a boot
	   block or other file and damaging it in the process by ignorance
	   of special conditions.

	2) Although it might spread, I believe it would not spread as fast
	   or as effectively as a 'harmful' virus.

	3) There are much safer ways to protect yourself from viri, other
	   than by exposing yourself to a theoretically 'harmless' live virus.

I see later in your message that you do mention that the Salk vaccine
does cause the occasional case of polio.  However, I find your minimal
emphasis on that danger when there are *known*safer* methods rather
alarming.

Back when Salk was the only vaccine around, it made sense to use it.
It was better than having polio epidemics, and the chances of getting
polio from the vaccine were much less than those of contracting it
'naturally'.

If all we HAD were anti-virus-viri, then I would agree to their
existance.  But we have MUCH safer methods to protect ourselves from
viri, so as far as I am concerned, there is NO reason to sanction
AVV's as 'acceptable behaviour'.

In parallel, if all we had were the Salk vaccine, I would use it.  But
we have much safer vaccines available now, so I see NO reason to use
the Salk vaccine.

Those who refuse to protect themselves deserve what they get.  Some
will decry this as a 'cold', 'brutal' answer.  Well it is, and so is
nature.  If you don't get vaccinated for the various diseases for
which we have safe vaccines, then you've only yourself to blame.

Subject: Weird Mac Behaviour... (Mac)

Hello,

  I think that my Mac IIcx was infected with a new virus.  I have SAM
II, Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid running all the time.  I was
installing some software that I purchased from MacFriends onto my
computer.  There were about 10 fonts from Adobe and 10 from Bitstream
and ColorStudio from Letraset.

The system was fine before the software installation began.  I might
add that MacFriends had sent the Adobe fonts on their own labeled
disks (? very strange) I'll have to ask them about that later.  I had
a recent backup so I was not too worried once the 'weird' stuff began.

After I installed ColorStudio I tried to boot it up, but it asked me
for the Settings file and then crashed.  I rebooted and noticed that
the SunDesk icon was now upside down!!!  I checked the ColorStudio
program disks for the settings file, but it wasn't there -- by the way
I did purchase the program and it was fresh out of the shrinkwrap.  I
then tried to open the Control Panel and it told me that the system
was missing some system resources.  After opening up the system folder
I tried moving some inits because I thought I was having init
conflicts -- the inits couldn't be moved.  The system said file
busy/in use.  I was pissed!!!  I booted again from a floppy and tried
to move the files and I got the same message.  I then rebooted the mac
from the hard drive and got a message stating that the finder was
damaged and I should use the Installer to correct it.  I did and
rebooted.

This time the SunDesk Icon was upsidedown and small, with some other
trash.  The mac hung and I rebooted -- the system then started up and
only loaded four of my 15 inits and Cdev's!!  Realizing that something
was very wrong I tried to move the SunDesk icon and couldn't do it.  I
tried to delete the file and it seemed to be ok this time.  I closed
up the system folder and then opened it a few minutes later.  The
deleted files were back!!

I ran SumII on the disk and many files were listed as having their
checksum as changed.  I didn't want to infect anymore disks so I
initialized the disk and restored it.  That's where I am now.  I put
the fonts back on because I desperately need them, but ColorStudio is
off and I don't know what to make of my problems!!

HELP....HELP....HELP  has anyone seen anything like this before???

Please respond to me even if you want to take a guess......

Subject: 10000 was not a virus (PC)

Yesterday I wrote that F-PROT was able to handle the removal of a previously
unknown 10000 byte virus.  This turned out to be somewhat incorrect, as this
was not a single virus, but a combination of two viruses

	Plastique 5.21   4096 bytes
	Jerusalem        1808+5 bytes
        Plastique 5.21   4096 bytes
                      =======
                        10000+5 bytes

This 10000 byte block somehow managed to replicate as if it was a single virus.
It seems that the following sequence of events must have happened:

	A program is infected with Plastique, which adds 4096 bytes in front
 	of the .COM file.

	It is then infected by Jerusalem, which adds 1808 bytes to in front
	of the Plastique virus, and appends a 5-byte signature to the end.

	The next time Plastique sees the program, it will reinfect it,
	because it does not find its signature at the beginning of the file.

	Now, when the program is executed, it will not be infected again by
	Jerusalem, as it appears to be already infected (signature at end of
	file), nor will it be infected by Plastique (signature at beginning
	of file.

Rather remarkable....
