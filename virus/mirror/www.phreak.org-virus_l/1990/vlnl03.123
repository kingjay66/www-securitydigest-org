VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Well, you can turn the machine off, and leave it off!   *8)

More seriously, Fred Cohen showed awhile back, in his thesis, that no
100% perfect virus detector is possible (all detectors will either
miss some viruses, or accuse some non-viral programs of being
viruses).  On the practical side, it seems unlikely that any
anti-virus can be even close to 100% effective against unknown
viruses, since that would require being able to tell an intended
change from an unintended change (and if we could do that, we could
find all *bugs*, not just all viruses...).

It's relatively easy, in general, to be 100% effective against
any given *known* virus.

SCANV64 apparently has an error that causes it to identify
Stoned-infected diskettes as having both the Stoned and the Stoned-II.
Try just removing the Stoned, and see if that fixes it.  (In general,
I can't think of a way a diskette could have two different viruses in
the same boot sector, at least not with the kinds of boot-sector
infectors that we've seen so far.  Of course, there could be one virus
in the boot sector, and another in the saved copy of the "original"
boot sector stashed away by the first, but a scanner that just read
the boot sector would see only one virus.)

I am the PC tech for our microcomputer lab here at Cal Poly.  I have
installed VSHIELD on all of our machines. (these include 4 PS/2 50's).
We are running various software, including MS word v5.  I have not seen
any problems of the sort that you describe.  A suggestion would be to try
setting up a batch file that removes VSHIELD before startup of MS word and
the reinstalls after returning from Word.  (vshield /remove is the option)

I had to do this with Word and several other programs that needed their
memory clean.  Hope this helps.

I wrote a program for the PC called VPROT which "sort of" achieves this.
The program examines files (.EXE, .COM, whatever) and adds a two-byte
checksum to the end of the file.  You can pass the file through an encrypting
filter before generating the checksum to reduce the chances of a virus
realizing the file is protected.

Then, you periodically run the program to ensure that the file checksums
are still valid.  If a virus has modified the file, chances are high that
the checksum is wrong, because I used the CRC-16 generating polynomial.

BUT:

1) This does not protect the boot sector, although the idea can be
   extended to cover this case.

2) If you "protect" files which are ALREADY infected, you're in trouble.

3) You must run the program fairly often to check your files.

4) If a virus is found, you need another tool to disinfect it.

So, is it worth it?  I guess if you copy lots of software from a BBS
or other "suspicious" sources, it is.  Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

Subject: Virus Catalog edition 6/90

Apart from the first MacVirus entries (which are under revision and will be
available by July 20), the June edition of the Virus catalog adds 61 new
virus descriptions and updates several earlier descriptions. In order to
allow for easier distribution, I am willing to send new entries to servers
provided that interested operators inform me about their interest and give
me their electronic mail adresses.     Klaus Brunnstein

Subject: Re: Internet worm code (UNIX)

 Three months ago there was a rumor that the code was to
be published in June 1990 issue of Unix World. Unfortunately
not much was published, none of the functional parts of the
Worm, just a reconstruction of main(). I'm afraid no
mainstream publisher would publish virus code as most people
think such code should not be public. However there is an
underground publisher, the 2600 magazine. who sells the
code for $10.00 . They have a Nwe York address which unfortunately
I cannot find now. Maybe somebody on the network knows it.

Unix Review did just have a detailed article on the Internet Worm.
It provided a good solid description of the strategy and mechanisms
used and some code fragments -- but the author made the point that the
code supplied was far from enough to be picked up and used.

Yup.  Do a *complete* backup of your system today or tomorrow.
Keep the backup in a safe place.

If something happens on the 13th, boot the system from a protected
floppy, set the date/time to 10 minutes after you finished your
backup, then restore the files and get rid of the infection (by
deleting bad files or running disinfectant-type programs).

If you are really adventuresome, set the clock ahead to the 13th (or
14th) immediately after you've done your backups.  That way, you won't
lose any changes that you make between the backup and the time
anything happens (if anything does).

There is no need to panic or run right out and buy any software.  If
anything happens, a good set of backups and a little common sense are
all you need to handle the problem.

Subject: RE: File Shield (PC)

When a file, which has File Shield installed on it, is being executed,
File Shield checks the file size and the file date/time.

What Dr. Marchese did - he changed the file using Norton Utilities which
does not change the file size or the file date/time stamp. File Shield
is supposed to remove viruses not anything else! 95% of the viruses changes
the file size and sometimes even the file date/time stamp. There are other
viruses (the left 5%) which are considered as Stealth viruses like the
4096 virus. File Shield alone cannot detect that virus while the virus is
active in memory because the virus hides its real file size. People who
register File Shield also receive a very small devide driver (400 bytes)
which is installed in the CONFIG.SYS and can identify whether a file was
infected even if it was infected by the 4096 virus.

That would off course be true if you scan ANYTHING on your disk.
However, since virusses are only dangerous when they are executed,
most scanners only scan boot sectors, .COM files and ..EXE files. By
doing so, this digest would NOT be marked infected, in fact it
wouldn't be marked at all since it's a plain text file. The same holds
for .DAT files or any file that contains no executable code. Off
course there could be such clever virusses that hide part of
themselves in other files than the ones which they are invoked from.
In that case scanning a file for ASCII text makes no sense. You would
have to scan for the part that will initially be executed, the first
few instructions of the virus. Otherwise you'll not be able to tell
WHICH file causes the malfunctioning of your system.
