We recently got a sample of that from Switzerland as well.  It infects
both floppy diskettes and the bootable partition of hard disks.  The
only side-effect I've found is that it will cause the speaker to click
while typing under some circumstances.  Usual disclaimers, of course;
what you've seen may not be the same virus that I've seen!

I have not encountered any difficulty in running the two together.
VSHIELD is loaded at the beginning of my autoexec.bat and subsequently
I load WIN 3.0 from a menu.  If anybody does have problems with this
or a different configuration, I'd also like to hear about it.

There are actually two different virus groups called "Yankee Doodle".  Both are
from Bulgaria, but they are different in several ways.

    Group 1: "Old Yankee" infects only .EXE files. When an infected program is
    run, the virus does a full-depth recursive search on the current directory,
    until a non-infected file is found, which will then be infected. The
    virus then plays the Yankee Doodle tune and transfers control to the
    original program. It does not remain resident in memory.  Infected
    files are marked by placing the word "motherfucker" at the end.
    Two variants are known one 1961 byte and another, shorter one, only 1621
    bytes, which does not play the tune - it does nothing but replicate. More
    variants are expected in the future, as the author has distributed the
    source to the virus.

    Group 2: TP's "Yankee Doodle".  Versions 26-44+ of the TP series of
    viruses (which includes the "Vacsina" viruses as well) also play Yankee
    Doodle.  Versions 26-32 play it when Atrl-Alt-Del is pressed, 33-43 play
    it at 5pm, but versions 44- have only a 1-in8 chance of playing it at that
    time.  Those viruses are resident, and quite a bit longer than the other
    ones 2-3.5K

Compared to many other viruses, the "Yankee-Doodle" viruses are fairly
harmless, but nevertheless a problem.

Three program that can (I think) find all the known variants

    VIRSCAN  from IBM
    SCAN     from McAfee
    F-PROT   my own - which can remove them all as well :-)

A virus known as "FLIPPER" has 'woken up' on the Apple Mac in the Arts.  It was
removed by Disinfectant in early June, but it is possible it is still on some

A word to the wise is sufficient, isn't it?  Well, the word in this
case is "hashing" ....

  BTW, the implementation of the new UnVirus has since been speeded up
so that it's now almost 4 times as fast as SCAN.


  I was also asked in a personal letter what I meant when I wrote in
the same posting:
>       *freeware* (often erroneously called "public domain" software).

Since "public domain" is a legal term, some of what I'm about to write
may not be entirely accurate, but I think my conclusion will still be
valid.  As I understand it, "public domain" means (at least approxi-
mately) *not copyrighted*.  Previous postings here on copyrighting
have indicated that a program written after 1 Mar 89 (the date the
U.S. became a signatory to the Berne Convention) is automatically
copyrighted at the moment of creation, without need for a copyright
notice.  It therefore seems to me that a program written after this
date (in the U.S.) can be PD only if its author explicitly states that
he releases it to the public domain or that he waives all his rights.
And such cases constitute only a very small portion of the programs
available on most so-called "PD" servers, even if we restrict our-
selves to freeware.
  True, a program written before 1 Mar 89 is not copyrighted unless it
bears a copyright notice of the form "Copyright year name", and many
authors thought they could write "(C)" instead of "Copyright", which
is incorrect.  So maybe such programs would be considered PD if such a
matter ever came to court.  In any case, the *concept* or *definition*
of "public domain" is very different from that of "freeware", and
that's all I was claiming.

  Disclaimer: I have no legal background; if anyone with such a back-
ground finds an error in what I've written, I shall repent.

   That also was about two years before the time that the Security group
at SHARE formed, which developed the specifications for the product which
became ACF2 in 1978.  Simultaneously, IBM was secretly developing RACF.
By the early 80's, ACF2 was beginning to dominate the MVS system security
market, and it became much more difficult for hackers who were not in the
systems programming groups to make significant intrusions into MVS
systems.  RACF was slow to develop because, in many people's opinions, it
was conceptually a poor design.  These days, though, many MVS sites do use
it.
   It is true that some of the architectural features of the original MVS
still exist in MVS/XA, making it possible to obtain system privileges.
Those who have been involved with MVS systems programming over the years
know the features well.  But on systems which are routinely managed by
ACF2, TopSecret, or RACF, it is very difficult for a person outside the
systems programming group to exploit those features.  There also are
extensive auditing tools and methods for monitoring systems, and, unlike
micros, MVS systems generally do not update or upgrade themselves while
they are running.  It is still possible, but unlikely.  With 15 years on
MVS systems in many companies, 10 on ACF2 and RACF protected systems, I
personally have never heard of a case of an unauthorized system update
caused by someone outside the systems programming group.  I'm sure they're
there, but if they were common, I guess I would have heard about a few
through one of my employers, or through my consulting business, or through
the ACF2 conventions, through SHARE, or through the regional ACF2 user's
group I was heavily involved with.  I didn't.
   Things are about to become tighter, too.  Computer Associates is in the
process of raising the rating of ACF2 and Top Secret from C2 to B1.
   On Digital VAXs, the VMS system technically is C2, but in my opinion
the architecture is so cumbersome that systems managers have some
justification when they say that you need system privileges all the time
just to do a job.  Yes, it's C2, but so many people end up with privileges
that it hardly matters.

Subject: Re: Mainframe attacks (MVS)

While we are talking mainframe attacks, way back in 1976 or so, some
of my crowd of hackers, discovered that if you ran a program that upped
your privlege level temporarily in order to run (there were several), then
hit CTRL and BREAK backand forth several times rapidly, the os would get
confused.  Then when you exited your session, your account table was dumped
back to disk with the result that when you logged on again, you had A0
(system administrator) privelege, and could do anything you jolly well
pleased.  The hole was plugged within a couple of days, but I understand
that certain other accounts were created in the mean time that allowed
unfettered access to the machine.
I once had a psychology prof, who imparted a real jewel to the class.

"Operating systems are as secure as they are.

Subject: Re: Discussion: definitions of common computer beasts (ie. viruses..)

Here are my definitions of virus, worm and Trojan horse:

    virus        - a dependent self-replicating program.

    worm         - an independent self-replicating program.

    Trojan horse - a program with a hidden agenda.

By dependent, I mean that a virus "lives" within another program.

I do not believe that the definition of a worm has anything to do with
networks.  I think that association has risen due to the infamy of the
Internet worm.

I took the definition for a Trojan horse directly from Maarten Van Swaay.
I also think that a Trojan horse is the program that carries the
"payload," not the payload itself.  (Remember, the Trojan horse of
literature *contained* the suprise.)

When describing virii, worms, etc, many people end up by saying something
like "... and does something bad, like erase your files."  Granted, the
people who create these things and set them loose quite often put in
something nasty, but that isn't really part of what they are.  It is simply
how they are used.  If someone writes a program with a beneficial hidden
agenda, the program is still a Trojan horse.

Subject: On Tippett's "Kinetics..."

Various people have mentioned Dr. Peter Tippett's paper "The Kinetics
of Computer Virus Replication" here recently.  We wrote a brief reply
to the paper awhile back, and I thought it might be reasonable to post
it.  This isn't an Official IBM Statement or anything like that, just
the reaction of the researchers here at the High Integrity Computing
lab.  (I don't know how people in general can get a copy of the paper
itself, I'm afraid.  I don't know whether it's been formally published
anywhere; the copy we have was apparently handed out at a press
conference.)

     The conclusions in Dr. Tippett's paper are based on a very
simple model of uncontrolled, exponential growth.  We are not
convinced that the assumptions or conclusions of the paper are
correct, and they do not seem to be supported by the actual data
available to us.  The model neglects several effects that we think
are crucial to understanding virus spread.  We think substantially
more work in modelling virus spread will be required before it's
possible to make valid quantitative predictions.

     Tippett's analogy with runaway biological growth neglects the
paths along which programs are shared (the "sharing topology"), and
incorrectly models the effects of widespread scanning on virus
growth.  Our own preliminary studies of very crude models which
incorporate program sharing and scanning indicate that, under
certain conditions, the fraction of infected machines can stabilize
at a much lower value than Tippett suggests ( < 1% in some cases).
Furthermore, if the scanning rate for a known virus were sufficiently
high, the exponential growth of the virus population predicted by
Tippett would reverse, and the virus would eventually become
extinct.  This is in contradiction to Tippett's conclusion that
scanning is ineffectual.  (To anyone interested in looking into some
good work on modelling the spread of biological viruses, we'd
suggest consulting recent issues of the journal "Mathematical
Biosciences".)

     Our own data on virus incidents do not show any trend towards
explosive growth, neither for viruses in general nor for the 1813
and Brain viruses which Tippett discusses.  We would be very
interested in seeing other reliable data on virus populations as a
function of time.

     We are rather confused at Tippett's assertion that "systems
management software" can contribute to real improvement in the
problem, whereas other methods cannot.  No evidence is presented for
this in the paper, and it would appear that the same analysis that
is used to claim that scanning is ineffective could be applied to
virtually any other method of reducing the virus population,
including the use of systems management software.

     We believe that, in order to make reasonable predictions about
the population dynamics of computer viruses, we need to formulate
more realistic models which incorporate some aspects of the virtual
and physical connectedness of the world's computers and at least a
minimal understanding of human habits.  The analysis and interpretation
of such a model will not be easy, but the success that mathematical
epidemiologists have achieved in understanding the spread of some
infectious diseases encourages us to think that we will be able to
do it.

My thanks to Padgett for so clearly expressing what I have been unable
to say on this forum. As a vendor, it's hard for me to come here and
initiate discussions about my own products. Be warned: I am speaking
about my own commercial product here.

Our "SafeWord VIRUS-Safe" performs exactly as Padgett describes above.
It was designed with EXACTLY this kind of situation in mind. It also
maintaines a detailed log of changes to files so a virus researcher
can figure out what kind of virus may have been polluting things. The
log reveals the date and time of detected changes, before-and-after
signatures using any industry-standard signature algorithms, length
changes, etc. If That's what you are looking for, please give me a

I'm sorry I didn't post this before, but the way things are at
the moment, I rarely get to eat.

The Form virus is a Swiss product. It has apparently infected
most of the schools in canton Zug so I'm not surprised that
you have got it at ETH Zuerich.

To make it short: it is indeed a boot sector virus. It will
infect floppies as well as hard disks. It has a damage: on
every 24th of any month it will make the keys click, but
it doesn't seem to work on my machine. Otherwise it is not
destructive. It is well programmed, and doesn't seem to have
been derived directly from any other virus. Normally it
should not bother you.

I had promised an antivirus for it, but time didn't allow it.
Like most boot sector viruses, it can be removed (or at least
deactivated) by booting from a _clean_ disk and using the SYS
command to overwrite the virus boot sector.
