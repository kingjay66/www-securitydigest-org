VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I asked John Norstad, author of Disinfectant, to confirm or refute
this, and here is his reply:

>Yes, it's possible, but it doesn't seem to happen very often.

I'm posting his answer because I thought that people might be
interested in seeing it confirmed by him.

Subject: stealth viruses..

In a recent msg, someone said that a "stealth" virus could evade
checksum and CRC checks.  Can anyone tell me how this is done?
Wouldn't the author of the virus have to know the checksum/CRC
technique being used in detail?  Without specific knowledge of the
polynomial being used, what could the virus author do?

I can imagine that certain values wouldn't contribute to the checksum,
but if you make the original size of the file part of the check, then
adding those special values will change the file size, and render it
detectable.

In short, it seems that if I am willing to give up the detection of
virus propagation in real-time, I should be able to detect viruses ALL
THE TIME (of course, if and only if I have a confirmed clean system to
begin with).

what am I missing?

Subject: New MS-DOS Virus (PC)

Have just had an opportunity to examine (briefly) a new virus as yet
unnamed (DataLock/920 ?). This does not appear to be a very great
threat since it does apparently nothing to hide itself (but then,
neither does the Jerusalem).

The virus infects a machine by running an infected file. It goes
resident in the Top Of Memory reducing a CHKDSK return by 2048 bytes
(a 640k machine will return 653312 bytes total memory instead of
655360. Int 12 is not affected so a comparison will result in a
mismatch similar to the 4096. Each time an .EXE file is executed, it
will increase in size by 920 bytes. The virus will only infect a file
once but will infect any .EXE executed. The string "DataLock version
1.00" was found in clear near the end of an infected test file & at
location 9000:fca8 in memory on my 640k isolation machine.

The virus appears to trap INT 21 and determines if it is in memory by
returning a value of 1234 in AX if INT 21 is called with function BE.

The current version of SCAN (v67c) does not yet detect this but all of
you do check the "three bytes", don't you.

Further information will be posted as discovered.

Subject: Stoned in C: (PC)

According to ScanV67, the partition table of my hard disk has been
infected with the "Stoned" virus.

Two questions:

What effects might I see with this particular infection?

*AND*, more importantly, how can I get rid of "Stoned" ??  Is there
a virus-killer program available ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

There has been lots of talk about anti-virus software for the mac and
PC but what about on the NeXT. I have a NeXTstation on backorder :-(
and when it arrives I was planning on downloading lots of software for
it, however I worry about picking up something I don't know how to
deal with.

P.S. Pardon any mistakes, this is my first post to the net.

Can anyone explain what the Sunday virus is?  It seems to be going
around (the town I live in).  What does McAfee's clean really do?
Does it make the infected program reusable?

Subject: "Novell" virus? (PC)

From:    William J. Hobson
I have read one side of the "Novell Virus" controversy here and
another side from a Novellemployee on the Novell newsgroup basically
saying the infection was not duplicateable on a properly set up
network.  Has anyone ascertained the truth yet (seeing a comment on
this list to the effect that there would be a seminar at an upcoming
security conference on this subject prompted me to ask this question).
Enquiring minds want to know!

Subject: OS/2 Viruses (OS/2)

I am doing research for a paper on viruses in OS/2 systems.  I will be
covering OS/2-specific viruses (only theoretically at this point) as
well as DOS viruses on mixed DOS and OS/2 systems.  If anyone has any
information on this topic (real life experiences, references, etc.) I
would very much appreciate it if you could e-mail it to me at
khv@nihdcrt on Bitnet.  Questions of interest concern the possibility
of DOS viruses infecting and corrupting a system when an infected
program is run in the DOS box of OS/2.  Are only some types of DOS
viruses capable of doing this?  Is the damage different from what
would occur on a DOS machine.  Is it possible for DOS memory-resident
viruses to activate in the DOS box?  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Re: Products for detecting Viruses

In volume 182, Johnathan Vail refers to my company's product "SafeWord
VIRUS-Safe", stating "This technique seems to be a good one for
screening for *propogation* if viruses on a system or network." He
then asked me some questions, which I hereby answer as follows:

>Q: This doesn't detect the program that is spreading the virus, only
>the ones that have been subsequently infected. Correct?

A: Correct. The information necessary to identify the offending virus
is stored in a separate "audit trail" file that records the
before-and-after file sizes, before-and-after signatures, date and time
when signatures were verified and date and time when changes were
detected, and also a record of when the user was notified of detected
changes and how the user decided to handle the situation. The intent
here is that the audit trail file will help a virus troubleshooter make
a quick and accurate determination of what has caused the problem, when
it entered the system, and how far it has spread.

>Q: Does this provide any protection from attacks on COMMAND.COM, boot
sectors or general attacks through DOS or BIOS?

A: Yes. Also on IBMBIO.COM (and functional equivalents by other
names), IBMDOS.COM (and functional equivalents by other names),
partition tables, any normally unused sectors that usually reside
physically adjacent to these items, the "leftover" bytes between the
ends of these items and the clusters containing them, etc.

>Q: Are there programs that legitimately modify themselves with various
defaults and setup that can trigger the virus detector?

A: Yes. Although these are fairly unusual, they do exist and we handle
them simply. Whenever a change is detected in a file, we open up a
window and ask the user if they know of a good REASON why the change in
the file's signature should be authorized. We suggest the possibility
of a configuration change or update since the date when the previous
signature was calculated. If the operator indicates that the changed
signature is expected, then we record the operator's comments in the
audit trail file, update the corresponding file signature, and
proceed. We have found that the resulting audit trail paints a very
accurate and comprehensive picture of the integrity of the system, and
any patterns of infection are quickly deduced by a virus-knowledgeable
person that examines the audit trail file. This provides valuable
guidance to a virus expert armed with the latest from Skulasen or
McAfee.

(Remember, this is COMMERCIAL software, not shareware or
public-domain. It is intended for use in large populations of MS-DOS
machines as an integrity check, in support of a group of virus experts
armed with virus-specific removal tools.)

I have gotten several responses to my forwarding of Mr. Rowell's message.

Since they have been sent to me, it obviously wasn't clear that:
	1 - I did not originate this message, I only forwarded it to the virus-

Again please send ALL responses to Mr. Rowell

Subject: magazine with virus infected frontcover disk (PC)

A major incident with a German computer magazine happend!
name: DOS-TREND
publisher: Pearl-Agency
issue : 10/11
Some of the disks on the front cover seem to be infected with STONED II
I will get a sample on monday!
We had several people call our hotline complaining about this problem.
Sofar I suspect that this is another copy-shop problem (in this case
usually 10 to 12 percent of the production volume is infected)
Since the magazine has a total volume of 100000 the number of infected
disks can very well be 10 to 12 thousand!
More as soon as get a sample!
    Chris

Subject: Is this a virus? Help! (PC)

I recently noticed what seems to be a trojan on my PC. I notice two
files in my root directories (c and d) they have eight character
filenames (ex: 111E340A and 111E340F).  They are only displayed when I
type "dir | more" in my root directory. The file names change (as well
as the creation date) every time I iterate the command. The files are
0 length. They do not exist when I try to delete them. I am guessing
that they take on their new names after the directory listing is
taken. I have tried stripping out autoexec.bat and config.sys to
eliminate the possibility that they are some sort of work file created
by some memory resident program but they persist.  I Have also tried
doing a floppy boot (write protected) and attempt to do the directory
but no good. I am not a regular reader of comp.virus but I intend to
do so more regularly. If you know anything about this syndrome, please
help. Post if it's easier but mail if this is something easy to
eliminate or just some silly anomaly about DOS.

Thanks,
Rob
