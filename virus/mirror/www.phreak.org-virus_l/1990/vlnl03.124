Subject: WARNING Jerusalem B on Novell LANs (PC)

VALERT-L/VIRUS-L Readers:

CERT/CC received the following email message from Jon David, an
independent security consultant in the New York area.  The message
details a PC virus which apparently infects Novell LANs - regardless
of Novell file protections.  The virus has a trigger date of Friday
the 13th.  Also included here is a (typed in) FAX message from Novell
Vice President, Richard King, which presents Novell's official stance
on this issue at this time.  Mr. King's message was sent over Novell's
NetWire messaging system.  Please read both messages, as they present
differing viewpoints, and then draw your own conclusions.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE EXTENT OF THIS VIRUS IS AS YET
UNKNOWN.  Therefore caution, not panic, is advisable.

Scanners that detect the Jerusalem B virus may be effective at finding
infections of this virus.  Infected files should be deleted and
restored from trusted backups (such as original write-protected
distribution disks).

Regards,

Ken

Subject:  LAN virus!!!

I received a call recently from an authorized Novell distributor about
what looked to them like a LAN virus.  It sounded to me like a Jerusalem
B, and I gave them what help I could over the phone regarding proper
treatment.  They, in turn, send me diskettes with infected files.

Of 14 files, all .EXE, 1 was a DOS utility, 3 were Norton Utility
programs and the remaining 10 were NetWare programs which shouldn't have
been open to public access.  The infected system was running NetWare
2.15.  All 14 of the files were identified as 1813 by IBM's scanner, and
as Friday the 13th - Version 1 by DDI's VIRHUNT.

In cooperation with Jay Nickson, author of Quarantine (a LAN
anti-virus product) and Greg Drusdow (president on NUI - NetWare Users
International), I today started testing the virus under NetWare 2.15C.
(The system, and a ton of support, was provided by Novell.)

The virus infects both EXE and COM files, adding a bit more than 1800
hundred bytes to their length.  It will reinfect both types.  (One
file on the disks I received had been infected 56 times.)  It is a TSR
that hooks INT 21 if loaded before the LAN TSRs, and both 21 and 08 if
loaded after.  It will

    Alter date-time stamps locally or on the server, even if rights to
    do so have not been granted.

    Increase file lengths locally or on the server, even if rights to do
    so have not been granted.

    Delete, on being triggered, any EXE or COM invoked for execution
    before execution (Bad Command of file name message ... Note upper
    case "C" in Command) locally or on the server, even if rights to do
    so have not been granted.

THE VIRUS WILL TRIGGER ON FRIDAY, 7/13/90 !!!!!

No testing has been done on NetWare versions other than 2.15C.  It is
a pure guess as to the virus having the same effect on other versions.
ALL USERS OF ALL NETWARE VERSIONS ARE URGED TO ADVANCE THEIR SYSTEM
DATE TO 7/14/90 AT THE END OF SYSTEM USAGE - BOTH SERVERS AND NODES -
ON 7/12/90.

CHKDSK can be used at nodes after booting and before and after program
execution to indicate loss of available RAM or disk space (on dates
other than 7/13/90); on 7/13 (A DATE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE THERE FOR ANY
NETWARE SYSTEMS!!!)  the Bad Command or file name message should have
you calling for immediate help/shutting your system down/notifying
other LAN users/etc.

Novell technical personnel and all levels of management are completely
involved in the further analysis and treatment of this problem.  Both
NUI and Novell will be sending out appropriate notices on this matter
today, and both are doing everything I could think of in both
technical and administrative areas.

While Jay, Greg and I are, and for some time will be involved in
further analyses and treatments, I hope further information will be
forthcoming from official/proper channels.

(As I can't say other NetWare versions are likely targets or are
exempt, neither can I say either for other network operating systems.
I personally urge all LAN and stand-alone PC users to advance their
system dates on 7/12 - today - to 7/14; it's not nice having a virus
do your disk cleanup for you.)

NetWire Message
July 12, 1990

NetWare Users International (NUI) with the support of Novell has
conducted tests that have concluded that a variant f a Jerusalem B
computer virus has been discovered in at least one NetWare user site.
The virus infects DOS executable files.  In order to be exposed to the
virus one must import an infected DOS program from the outside.
NETWARE FILES ARE NOT INFECTED AS THEY SHIP IN THE RED BOX FROM
NOVELL.

The virus operates as a TSR.  Once an infected program is run at a DOS
PC, the virus takes residence in the PC memory as a TSR.
Subsequently, the virus, upon executing any other DOS program on the
PC, will attempt to infect the disk resident copy of that program.
The infection can occur on local drives as well as network drives
provided the workstation has appropriate acess rights to write and
modify the file.  Files on network operating systems other than
NetWare could also be infected by this virus.  Files infected with the
virus will show an increase in size of about 1800 bytes.

The real negative effects of the virus will not show itself until
certain preprogrammed dates.  One confirmed date is July 13, 1990.
There is a risk that an infected workstation will delete program
images on disk that are requested for execution on that date.  A "Bad
command or file name" message will result.  Under NetWare, the SALVAGE
command will restore a deleted file if executed properly.  If
infection is suspect, it is recommended that you advance the server
system date at the close of the working day of July 12, 1990 to July
14, 1990.  It is also recommended that professional assistance be
consulted.

These facts and report were prompted by a report to NUI.  Novell and
NUI in their concern for responsible leadership felt it necessary to
verify these conditions and notify its users so they could act
accordingly.

Subject: Need Info on Novell & Viruses (PC)

Can anyone assist me on where to find or who to contact for the
following information:

	Viruses which infect the Novell Operating System and/or files
	located on a Netware file server.

	Circumstances under which an MSDOS virus (PC virus)
	can transfer to a Novell file server.  Can this happen?  How
	and under what circumstances?

	Utilities to monitor and/or scan for viruses on a Netware file
	server.

Any help will be most appreciated.

Subject: "Invisible Virus Cruncher" (PC)

PC Business World for 3 July 1990 has an article entitled
"Invisible Virus Cruncher".  The text includes the following:
"...the product, Immunizer, can stop all known viruses and even ones that have
yet to be dreamed up. ...Immunizer is the only anti-virus product capable
of actually defending itself against attack from the new strain of
killer viruses...because it has several defence mechanisms, including the
ability to reload itself from disc."  It costs 98pounds; nothing is
said about site licences.  Phone no is +44-274-610503.

Anyone know anything about it beyond this hype?

Subject: Virsuses on Novell (PC)

This subject may have been flloged to death previusly, if so could someone
send me a resume, otherwise:-

Are files held on a novell fileserver as executae-only liable to be
infected by virsuses.

I use "scan" to check them before switching on the execute only mode,
so feel reasonably sure they are ok when installed. I wish to stop
users copying off the software, and this appears to be a very
effective way of doing it.

Netscan will not check these files becasue it does not have permission
to open the files for reading. This prevents a problem in checking
them further in the future.

These files can not have the execute only mode removed, but can be
overwritten by anybody with permission (which is set to only the
supervisor).

I feel this may generate much discussion, please send me a copy of any
comments I will write a summary when a consensus had been reached.

Thanks

Subject: Ping-Pong Virus Crashing Hard Drives (PC)

We have a version of the Ping Pong virus which infects Hard Disks,
spreads via non-bootable as well as bootable disks, and cannot be
successfully removed by the Sys command. Issuing a sys command results
in a corrupted hard disk, in one case the FAT was completely mangled,
in a second case the files appear to be intact but the hard drive will
not boot- gives a "non-system disk or disk error". Reissuing Sys
doesn't correct the situation, although it appears to have been
successful....  The system with the corrupt files was identified as
having the Ping Pong virus by Scan, the other system was not tested
with any scanning software but appeared to at least emulate the
symptoms of ping Pong.  Anybody else heard of this bad Ping-pong? Any
suggestions (short of reformatting the drives) for either prevention
or cure?

Thanks in advance  for any ideas!

Subject: Changed checksums on boot sector? (PC)

Hi. One of my colleagues has found that the checksum of the boot sector on
his PC's hard-disk has changed...! None of the usual virus detecting
programs report anything unusual, neither does there appear to be
any change to any of the sizes of any of his other files, nor are there
bad sectors on the hard disk. He suspects a boot-sector virus even though
he has seen no symptoms of anything.
Floppy disks used with his system are likewise apparently clean with
no obvious infections/lost sectors.
I suspect that someone may have done a SYS to his disk, with a different
version of DOS. I guess there will be differences between 'Generic'
MS-DOS and 'proprietary' IBM PC-dos even though they are functionally the
same, and both DOS3.3's.
Does this make sense, or should i start crawling through his boot sector
and looking for nasties?
