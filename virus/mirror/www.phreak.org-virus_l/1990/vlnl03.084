Huh?  Under VM, at least, a CLASS A user (the VM-equivalent of a
"superuser") can modify REAL storage very easily.

I expect that most systems will continue to provide such capabilities
as unrestricted write access to disk and memory (to "authorized" users)
because system installation and debugging would be near impossible
without them.  The best that can be done is to make *unauthorized*
access very unlikely, i.e., difficult.

Hello netland.

I'm giving a presentation on computer viruses, and I'd like some input.
I've done a fair ammount of basic research, but I want to make sure
I'm not missing anything crucial.  I'd like to know:

1) What do you consider the 3-5 most important references (books,
articles, etc.) on computer viruses?

2) What are the most effective current anti-viral programs for the IBM PC
and the Macintosh?  (Detection and/or prevention)

Thanks for any advice or opinions you care to share with me.

Subject: Friday 13'th Virus (Pc) Part 130, Probably

I work at a dogtrack in Alabama. Recently my boss told me that one of
our track people next door got hit by a "Friday The Thirteenth" virus,
and that the thing is now on this guy's hard disk. My boss thinks that
even if we format the hard drive, it is possible that the virus will
not go away. I, not being a virus expert, am not too sure whether he
is right or wrong, but in the interest of not taking chances, I
thought I should ask you guys anyway. Can we get rid of this moster by
reformatting the hard drive and giving him clean back-ups of all his
software? This is, by the way, happening in MS-Dos 3.3.

Subject: Repairing 1813-infected files (PC)

Speaking of files from which the 1813 (Jerusalem) virus can't be
removed, here are some results from some in-passing investigation we
did the other day:

  - The EXE files shipped with DOS version 4.00 end with a little
    32-byte trailer that contains the DOS version number and some
    other characters.   These are "off the end" of the file (after
    the part that the EXE header knows about), and the virus will
    overlay them when it infects.   Disinfection programs will therefore
    not be able to restore these programs to exactly their original
    states, although in our very incomplete testing this didn't
    seem to hurt the operation of the programs any.

  - FAPI ("Family API") programs, which run under both DOS and OS/2,
    generally will not execute correctly when infected by the 1813
    (most hang the system, some print messages of various kinds and
    then hang the system, and so on); this is almost certainly because
    in a FAPI EXE file, most of the actual program is "off the end",
    and the virus overlays it.   Disinfection programs will probably
    not be able to restore FAPI programs to a working state.  (This
    may be true of all EXE files that run under OS/2; we haven't
    tested the more general case.)

The 1813 is a significantly buggy virus; interesting that it's
spread so far, and survived so long...

Subject: System Error in VirDetective 4.0.2 (Mac)

I'm running system 6.0.3 and Finder 6.  When scanning more than one
disk (like if using a RamDisk or two drives), if the first disk has
it's window open, when VD mounts the drive, the window covers the
VD window, putting it in the 'background'.  Then when the scan is
complete on the second disk, VD reports any matched strings
with the dialog box.  When I hit OK to clear the box, I get a system
error.  This only occurs when both disks have matching strings
(i.e. it doesn't eject the second disk when completing the scan.)

Subject: McAfee's FSHIELD.EXE ver 1.2

Today I downloaded John McAfee's FSHIELD ver 1.2 program from simtel20.
This is a program which shields executable files so that virus infections
are detected and removed.

The program works when run on a machine running MSDOS 3.3.  However it
crashes when run on a machine running MSDOS 4.01 (plain MSDOS 4.01 and also
Compaq DOS 4.01) producing a Runtime error 006 at 0000:02E9.  Assuming that
this program was produced with Borland's Turbo Pascal, a runtime error of
6 corresponds to "Invalid file handle passed to DOS system call".

There is nothing in the documentation file of FSHIELD indicating
incompatability with DOS 4.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?

I realise that perhaps I should in the first instance contact John McAfee
rather than post but transatlantic phone calls don't come cheap.

Subject: SCAN and ShareWare (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
=========================================================================

	Joseph Young asked a number of pertimemt questions about the
SCAN product line and about shareware in general.  SCAN and the associated
programs are indeed shareware, but this does not mean they are free.
Shareware should be distinguished from freeware.  Shareware is a distribution
methodology that depends upon the fundamental honesty (or dishonesty) of
the product's users.  If you like the programs and intend to continue using
them, then they need to be registered.  This is a common practice in the
shareware world.  SCAN, in addition, has a limitede use clause in business
or organizational environments.  This is beacuse scanners, unlike word
processors or spreadsheet programs, tend to multiply faster than viruses
in an organizational environment.  The result is that we end up supporting
hundreds of users through multiple infection occurrences and we receive
no re-imbursement for it.  In an effort to limit this drain on our
resources, we require site licenses for large organizations.  A site
license, for example, for 500 machines for SCAN, CLEAN, NETSCAN, VSHIELD
and SENTRY is aroiund $9,000.  This amounts to $3.60 per product per
machine.  Our support costs for two years are projected at $2.70 per
product per machine, so the margins are slim.  The $2,000 netscan price
is our upper price limit for an unlimited number of machines on an
unlimited number of networks.
	This may seem like a lot of money for a shareware product, but
if you compare prices to non-shareware products you will find these prices
as much as 100 times cheaper than comparable non-shareware products.
	Again, as most shareware authors will agree - shareware is NOT
freeware.

Sure he can!   He can write to an object library of his own that
someone else uses (via either read-write or read-only access).
I think that's a rather typical sharing pattern on mainframes;
I have read/write access to my programs and utilities and such,
and other people who want to use them have read-only access.
That's how it tends to be in program-development environments,
anyway, and in at least many others.  So I run an infected
program, it infects a number of the other programs I own,
someone else runs one of those and infects a number of her
programs, two other people run one of her infected programs...

<Followed by a nice summary of how users' address spaces are protected
 from each other in MVS and VM and cetera.>

Protected memory really isn't all that relevant to virus spread;
a virus doesn't have to "address outside of his own address space"
or "get control of system functions".   All it has to do is put
a copy of itself into one or more places (generally executable
files like object libraries, MODULEs, or whatever) to which it
is -allowed- to write, in such a way that someone else may
later execute it.   If there aren't any executable places that
it's allowed to write to at the moment, it just does nothing.
Unless it's the case that virtually every program executes
virtually always in a state where it can write to virtually
no other programs, viruses can probably spread with ease.

> With regard to file copying, copy utility programs aren't
> other-modifying in the sense that I get from your posting, Dave.

Yes, they are; I probably didn't express myself well.   The
original claim was that no program has to have write-access to
any other.   But in order to use a copy utility, the copy
utility must have write-access to the file that it's creating.
So if your copy utility is infected, it could infect any file
that it's asked to copy (since it has to have write-access
to the target copy, the access controls aren't going to
stop it).  That's what I meant.

Computer Virus Books

The April 23, 1990 issue of COMPUTERWORLD (p. 79) takes a
look at four books that have been published in recent months
on computer viruses. Here is a brief description of each
title:

1) "Computer Virus Handbook," edited by Harold Highland,
Elsevier Advanced Technology, $153.

According to COMPUTERWORLD this book "is one of the most
comprehensive books on viruses and includes contributions by
many of the top virus watchers." It includes information on
the history of viruses, the many strains currently on the
loose and how to combat them. COMPUTERWORLD considers the
book "pricey but worth it if you are an IS manager or
computer security specialist...."

2) "Computer Viruses: Dealing with Electronic Vandalism and
Programmed Threats," by Eugene Spafford, Kathleen Heaphy and
David Ferbrache, Adapso, $30.

Adapso, the computer and software industry association,
published this how-to book for IS professionals on
identifying, preventing and, if necessary, cleaning up after
virus attacks. Although, according to COMPUTERWORLD, many
books covering viruses focus exclusively on rogue programs
designed to attack IBM and compatibles, this book covers
attacks on Apple Computer, Inc.'s Macintosh line.

3) "Virus! The Secret World of Computer Invaders that Breed
and Destroy," by Allan Lundell, Contemporary Books, $9.95.

According to COMPUTERWORLD, this book "evidently aims to
capitalize on the virus phenomenon by sensationalizing the
problem." It contains information "derived from cyberpunk
science fiction that is sometimes just short of gibberish,
but it also contains interesting information about the
history of viruses and attempts to get at the motivation of
virus authors, unlike most books on this topic."

4) "Computer Viruses, Worms, Data Diddlers, Killer Programs,
and Other Threats to Your System," by John McAfee and Colin
Hayes, St. Martin's Press, $16.95.

This "nifty book," says COMPUTERWORLD, is "packed with well-
written information on viruses, how they work and how to
defend against different sorts of attacks." The problem, the
reviewer explains, is that the book tends to promise more
than it delivers. The authors "devote most of their efforts
to writing about viruses but do not analyze other computer
system threats to that degree."

Subject: Bug in FSHIELD (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
==============================================================

     Version 1.3 of FSHIELD has just been released.  It fixes a
couple of bugs in version 1.2, the most serious of which was a
problem with removing the shield from COM files that were a
multiple of 16 bytes long.
     I would also like to point out that you cannot test FSHIELD
by simply making a random change to a shielded file.  FSHIELD
does not work that way.  It detects and removes any entity that
has ATTACHED to the host program in a manner consistent with
virus infection.  A random change to the host program does not
meet this criteria.  Test the shield with real viruses ar a test
virus of your own making if necessary.
     I have received a number of calls and messages stating that
the shield does not work because changes had been made to a
shielded file that were not fixed or detected.  The purpose of
the shield is not to guarantee the integrity of a program due to
transmission errors, disk failures, randomly lost bits etc.  It
was designed only to detect and automatically remove virus
infections.

I'm not trying to give anyone any ideas, and I haven't read the docs
close enough to know alot about it.  However, wouldn't it seem possible
that "someone" could modify McAfee's FSHIELD program so that when ran
to protect a program it infects it with "some virus" and give the user
a false sense of security?  I know that this is no different than any
infected program being ran and infecting another program.  But isn't this
just making it easier for wormers to distribute a virus?

Well then how can viruses spread between pc's?  pc's are isolated in the
most extreme: they have absolutely no connection between them.  Much better
than accounts on a common mainframe.

Try this scenario:

1) A mainframe users gets his hands on (or writes) an awesome game (or
   whatever) which has a virus in it.

2) It infects all of the executable files in his personal directory.

3) The system manager finds out about the "awesome game" and not knowing
   about the virus, copies it or any of the other infected files to a
   public directory (called games?) with access enabled for all users
   on the mainframe.

4) Many users all in many different accounts run the game and all get
   infected.

etcetera.  There are many variations to this scenario, all resulting
in wide spread viruses.

Viruses can spread from account to account on a mainframe the same way
they spread from pc to pc on micro's, but faster and easier because there
is greater connectivity.

But how does the copy program work?  It reads records from one file
and writes them to another.  What if you wrote a copy-like program
which reads records from one file, writes them to another, but
modifies some of the records.  One example is a program called an
editor.  Another is a program called a virus.  The 'editor' can edit
text or binary (executables).  So can any copy program.  How can
you stop the virus copy programs from working without stopping
the legitimate copy and editor programs?

Subject: 128 byte problem solved

Several weeks ago I posted a query regarding several .COM utilities on
a PC/XT here at WSU which I believed to be infected by a virus.

After further study, and consulation with Woody Baker at Eagle Signal
in Austin, TX, (Thanx Woody), we were able to determine that it was
*not* in fact a virus despite the fact that it had characteristics of
one and produced symptoms typical of a virus.  Apparently what
happened was that my hardware technician backed up the files with DOS
BACKUP command and didn't let me know.  I've never used DOS backup,
and was unaware that it prepends a 128 byte header to each file.  This
128 byte header prevented the proper exeution of some of these
programs, and caused frequent system crashes on the others that would
run.  I have restored the files using clean backups.

Thanx again to Woody, and others that were able to help me decipher
the assembler and hexidecimal code(s) to determine what was going on
here.
