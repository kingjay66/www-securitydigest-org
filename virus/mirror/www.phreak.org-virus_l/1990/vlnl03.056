VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Many WDEF reports --Why?

David Chess on Feb 13th said the he was <curious as to why we're
                                        <seeing all these WDEF reports

Well, I have been reading this list for about a year now.  It has
been most helpful to me in combating viurses on my campus.  I am
the Micro Computer Coordinator for our Computing Services department
and I want viruses kept out of our open computer clusters.  I depend
on Virus-L Digest to keep me informed about new viurses, and the best
way to check for them and rid my clusters of any that show up.

I understood from reading the list that many people in the US and
around the world are tracking viruses and wished to be notified if
a virus showed up in "our" computer(s).  Since I am grateful to the
people doing this work (because of the reasons above) I wanted to
cooperate and notify them when WDEF knocked on my door.  I feel that
I speak for many others who sent "wev'e  gotten WDEF" messages to the
list.  We wanted to do our part.

Now along comes John Norstad on Feb 15th and he says
       >I don't' think it's necessary for everybody to report
       >every sighting of WDEF....I gave up trying to keep
       >track of all the sightings....

Sooo, I am confused.  I really want to help.  I will report any
(first occurrence) of a virus here on my campus if you-all
want me to, and if it IS indeed helpful.  I will stay off the
electrons and not clog up the list with needless reports if that
is more helpful.

Of course, any one on this list can (and will) respond to my
query but PLEASE IDENTIFY yourself.  If you are a REAL virus
tracker please say so...If you aren't please note that also.

Subject: Etymology of the word "virus"

Greetings to the many classical linguists reading VIRUS-L :-) ,
would somebody please tell me the etymology of the word "virus" and
therefrom deduce the correct declination (esp. genitive & plural)...

I know this has been discussed before, but I'd like to get some truely
technical information. My dictionary of Latin & Greek word elements in
biology is strangely un-verbose on this matter. Could it be that "virus"
is an artificial term in the first place?

Thanks for enlightening me.

Virulentally,

Subject: Reading MAC diskettes on a PC

        We have a Zenith 248 (AT Clone) with a card called Matchmaker
which is connected to an 800K Macintosh 3 1/2 inch floppy drive.
MacIntosh disks can be read and *DATA* files can be transferred to any
PC disk.  There is also software to convert MacWrite files to either
ASCII or Word files (I forget which.) This sounds like what some of
you have been asking for, so I will give the address of this company:

          Micro Solutions, Inc.
          132 West Lincoln Hwy.
          DeKalb, Illinois 60115
          (815) 756-3411

          The system has worked well except for Port I/O conflict with
one of the optical disks on that system. For those into Port
conflicts, Matchmaker can be set to 330-335h,340-345h,230-235h or
240-245h.

          DISCLAIMER: I have no envolvement with Micro Solutions, Inc.
other than as a satisfied user.

Subject: Possible New VIRUS Or Just H/W Problem ? (Amiga)

[Ed. Re-posted from comp.sys.amiga.hardware.]

SYSTEM:
          Amiga 2000B, 1084s monitor, 2088 Bridge Board,
        Seagate Hard Disk.

SYMPTOM:
        Screen goes the _BACKGROUND_ colour.

DESCRIPTION:
        This happens at seemingly random times, however, it only
        occurs when there is some kind of screen activity,
        e.g. opening or closing a window. It occurs more frequently
        when the machine has been on for a while. The only way to get
        the screen back is rebooting.

        NOTE: I have full control of the computer at all times, I
        just can't see anything.

THINGS ATTEMPTED IN TERMS OF PINPOINTING IT:
        I've tried every virus checker I could get my hands on, they
        all come up with nothing. These include kdviii, virusX-3.20,
        novirus. I've opened up the machine to see if there are any lose
        chips, but there aren't. I've booted from a pristine, untouched
        workbench 1.3 disk at two times. Firstly upon soft booting, the
        screen did blank out. Secondly upon cold booting, the screen
        didn't go blank, however, this could be a coincidence.

OTHER INFO:
        I have a game called Hybris. After playing this for a while, the
        screen will "fuzz", what I mean is that the graphics seem to get
        confused and all I see is one big blur on the screen. I have
        tried this with two independent disks of the game (ie: I borrowed
        them from two different people). This may or may not have anything
        to do with the blanking.

HELP:
        If you do know anything about this, or have any kind of helpful
        comment, please email me. I am at my wits end. My computer has
        become virtually unusable. If people want, I will summarise
        and post responses.

THANKS:

Subject: Virus management software

At Villanova University, we have been subject to virus problems in the
past on some of our public access IBM, Zenith and Apple Mac systems.

The most recent encounter has been the STONED virus.

I'm looking for virus management software (ie. detecting, cleaning and
preventing virus infections) for standalone systems and workstations
on a Novell Netware v2.15 network.

I'm also interested in any experiences, comments on the VIRUSCAN and
other software products from McAfee Assoc. in California.

Please reply directly to me because I'm not subscribed to this list.

Subject: Viruses and Copyrights

Yesterday, Kelly Goen commented on the Brain virus author, Mohammed
Farooq Alvi.

>  Just an additional Note: due to a peculiarity in Pakistani law...
>  there is NO Copyright Law...

Pakistan became an adherent of the Berne Convention on 7/5/1948 and an
adherent of the Universal Copyright Convention on 4/28/1954.  Since
they are members of these two prestigious international organizations,
I find it difficult to believe they have "NO Copyright Law."  Perhaps
someone could explain this so-called peculiarity in Pakistani law that
voids copyright protection?

Curiously,

Subject: Information Request

 Hello, my name is Richard Willis and I am a Freshman in CompSci at
Clemson U in S.C.  I am doing a paper on the spread of viruses in the
last few years, the increase in sophistication we have seen in them,
and the adverse affects they have had, using the Internet Virus as an
example.  Could anyone recommend or send me information as to the
spread of viruses, descriptions of current and past viruses, and
examples of some of the more technical viruses in existence currently?
Any and all info will be welcomed.  Thanks!

Subject: Request Info On Unidentified Virus
Date: 10 March 1990
From: Paul K. Smith, Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, N.S.

        Recently in Moncton, N.B. a particularily nasty virus emerged.
The person suffering from this had used bulletin boards extensively
and indiscriminately. Ergo the source is unknown. The machine infected
was a PC AT.

        The effects of this virus was to fill up the hard drive and
RAM with gibberish thus rendering the machine unusable. The following
measures were taken in order to get rid of the problem:

1. The hard drive was reformatted.------No effect

2. The hard drive was low level reformatted.------No effect

3. The hard drive was physically disconnected and the system booted
   from the floppy with a clean DOS-----No effect

4. From the above it would appear that the virus is residing in some
   other hardware or even a chip possibly the BIOS (??).

        Not having any experience with viruses I am wondering do
these symptoms sound familiar to anybody? I would appreciate
anybody who may be familiar with the above and any solutions to
the problem. Replies may be addressed to:

Subject: Re: Scanning MAC diskettes on a PC

MAINT@UQAM.BITNET (Peter Jones) writes concerning using PC's with 3
1/2" drives to scan Mac floppies for viruses.

minich@a.cs.okstate.edu (Robert Minich) in response points out:

# 1) PCs cannot read Macintosh formatted floppies, unless you have some sort
# of hardware specifically made for that purpose.

Such hardware does exist for PCs. In addition, on Atari ST systems (to
introduce another variable) the Spectre GCR cartridge would make it
possible to safely scan Mac disks when using the ST in native mode
(though requiring additional software not provided with Spectre), and
when running the emulator, get infected just like any other Mac. Such
an environment might be of unique interest in studying viruses, but is
really overkill if eliminating and preventing infection is all that is
desired.

# 2) WDEF travels when an infected disk is inserted into a an UNPROTECTED Mac.

And can infect an ST using the Spectre emulator as well, if
unprotected. See next point.

# 3) [There are free, simple ways to protect against WDEF and other viruses
# on standard machines]

And such protection works on emulating STs, exactly as one would
expect.  Again, hardware solutions are overkill at the moment for the
restricted purpose of eliminating and preventing infection. There
might still be a real use in more involved settings (and may be a real
need sometime in the future, who knows?)

Subject: Viruses using Hamming (PC)

I just returned from a talk with Vesselin Bontchev, and must now
correct one of my previous remarks. It appears there is indeed a virus
that uses Hamming to maintain its integrity: they are the viruses
starting with the TP33 in the TP virus strain (Vacsina and one of the
Bulgarian Yankee viruses are in this strain.)

This is not the only point I must stand corrected at. There were many
mechanisms that I had hoped would never be used or that would be too
impractical for a virus programmer to use.  Unfortunately these have
apparently been used in many of the Bulgarian viruses. I think we may
see many of these coming over to the West at some point in time.

Looking at the viruses I have here, I am shocked by some of the ideas
they have implemented and their implications to the computer
community. Having experimented a bit with the 4096 and in the light of
some of the bulgarian viruses, I see bleak times ahead.

In Europe I think we will be swamped by Eastern viruses, by the end of
summer, the time a lot of West Germans will have come back from their
vacations in the East. This has happened in the past, but with the US.
Many vacationers seem to take their disks with them on holiday (dread
the thought).
