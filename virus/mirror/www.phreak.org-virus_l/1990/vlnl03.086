I'm not an MVS expert, it being one of the few OS's I've never worked on,
however several OS's differentiate between binary executables and text
files with a file attribute flag. If an OS writes, say, a file header to
executables a virus could home in on that as a way of identification.
Difficult, but then, writing a virus isn't all that easy anyway.

Well, maybe. However, users can't clobber /bin or even /usr/bin if you
don't let 'em. Same goes for /usr/lib etc... A sysadmin should test a
program before putting it in there anyway. 'Sides, in Unix you get mostly
SOURCE CODE as you have 80 Zillion different computers to run on. So I'm
running on a '386 and someone up the net is running on a sequent, and
someone else is running on a cray. Executables will not run on the lot.

<More COPY theory>

>But let's look at it a little more carefully.  If a copy program were to

Good way would be to search for opcodes. If you find, say, more than ten
in a file there's a good chance it's a program and you could clobber it.
I doubt you'd get more than a few random occurances of opcodes in a file
which could be translated to complete commands.

<Linking and Copy>

>If the file is executable, you can't very easily call the linker to re-
>link the file you have just zapped, (the user would wonder why it took 2

Why relink a file when you can just patch a binary image on the back?
And calling the linker, at least in C would be as easy as saying
system("Link Program");. If you wanted to diddle with the linker, you
could, on some OS's, spawn off a child process and have it sit in the
background.

What version computer? Couldn't you just set the date/time to Jan. 1
each time you log in? That would hold things until you could get the
vaccine. Also, would changing the parts of your drive do any good? If
this monster got on a hard drive, wouldn't your only option be to get
rid of the hard drive (Worst case) or reformat it? (That is, if the
vaccine doesn't work or the computer won't take the floppy)

Subject: Does the Stoned virus alter itself? (PC)

I've now seen several samples of the Stoned virus in which the unused
"LEGALISE MARIJUANA!" string at the end has been overlayed with junk.
In all cases, the trashed string starts "LEGALISEg", but the data
after that is not always identical.  Does anyone know of circumstances
under which the Stoned will copy itself inaccurately?  None spring to
mind looking at the code, but my guess would be that there's a
subtlish bug or interaction there.  (This isn't just idle curiousity,
quite; if we know how or how often these "mutations" occur, we can
tell how useful the altered string can be in helping to trace the
spread of various mutated strains.)  DC

Subject: Scan and Shareware. What are the Prices? (PC)

What exactly are the prices for site licenses for John McAfee's
software.  I send his company a letter and never got a reply.  I heard
through another System Manager that the price was $5000 for 100
computers (or $50 per unit).  It was recently posted to this newsgroup
that the price was $9,000 for 500 computers (or $18 per unit).  I
would like to know, officially, what the prices for Site Licenses are
and how they breakdown.

We don't have any problems with PC Viruses - Yet.  I think this is
because we have reformatted all the Hard drives recently.  We do have
serious problems with Mac viruses.  Fortunately we have SAM 1.3 and
this stops most problems.  It would be nice to have some sort of
protection for the PC's as well - I think it is a disaster waiting to
happen.  We only have a total of 18 PC's here and a rather Low
operating budget.  I cannot justify spending $50 per P.C..  $18 is
another matter.

Subject: Auto-Validation

  Could it be possible for a program (Scanners, etc) to be auto-validated?
If someone wants to distribute an infected SCAN.EXE he will modify it, then
he will edit the documentation with the new VALIDATE values. A program that
autovalidates itself will be more secure, even if the infection was accidental.

Subject: Stoned virus makes the big time? (PC)

Reports of the Stoned virus outside Australia/New_Zealand seem to have
picked up remarkably in the last few weeks (purely a subjective
impression).  I tend to suspect that the virus "got lucky", and made
it into one or more large distributions; does anyone know for sure (or
even have any good rumors)?  My current theory is that the main factor
in how widespread a virus is has little to do with the virus itself,
and much to do with whether it's managed to get shipped in a mass
mailing, uploaded in a popular program, etc.  DC

Subject: disk killer virus? (PC)

Does anyone know if the following is a known virus problem?  It happened to
a friend so I cannot relate every detail.  And then...

      The screen suddenly displays a message like

                 "Disk killer, do not turn off power unitl
                         processing completed"

The machine was turned off anyway and upon being turned on, lo and behold,
bad disk.  Reformat time and reload from backups.

If this is not a known virus, what may we do?  Can one grep or otherwise
search executable files for text strings like "disk killer"

Any help, hints, or observations will be welcomed;  thanks in advance

Subject: VSHIELDv62 problems? (PC)

I've been playing with VSHIELDv62 and testing it against a few viruses that
have accumulated over the months at our college and have come across a couple
of minor problems. I may be using the software incorrectly but here goes:

   1) VSHIELD will not detect the Ping Pong Version "B" virus after the
      harddisk has been infected. SCANv62 detects it and CLEANv62 gets
      rid of it.

   2) When I infect my harddisk with the Stoned virus, it works fine but
      does not return an errorlevel code of "1". That's the only other
      boot sector/partition table virus I have so I can't see if it works
      for others :-) My test batch file includes:

             VSHIELD/NOMEM
             IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO :VIRUS
             IF ERRORLEVEL 0 GOTO :NOVIRUS
             :VIRUS
             <various commands>
             :NOVIRUS
             <other various commands>

       Naturally, it runs the <other various commands>.

Any explanation/instruction would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: mainframe viruses should be as complex as pc viruses

Jim Molini explained how it is difficult to infect an MVS system.  I
don't even know what computer MVS runs on (IBM?), let alone details
about the operating system.

Let me say (in my opinion) that in VAX/VMS, it is no easier and no
harder to write an executable infecting virus than it is in MSDOS.

The virus is written basically the same way as it would be for a pc.  Here
are some of the steps:
1) Search for files with extension *.exe.
2) Check if already infected.
3) Read the file-to-infect and create a new file with the same name,
   but one version higher.
4) Change the execution transfer address to near the end of the file
   (or change the first instruction to a jmp to the end of the file).
4) Add the virus code at the end of the file.
5) Add a jump at the end of the virus to the begining of the .exe file.

Step 1 can be quite simple.  Only infect files in this directory.  We
never need infect system files, executables in local directories
is sufficient.  If the local executable is a program just written by
a programmer, and is subsequently copied into a public
directory then the virus has done well for itself.  But this is not
mandatory.

There is no need to re-link the program because the viral code is
added at the end of the program.  Relinking is only needed when code
is moved to a new address (the virus should be written in relocatable
code).  Isn't this the same as on PC's?

So I will reword my assertion:

Viruses can spread from account to account on VAX/VMS the same way
they spread from pc to pc on micro's, but faster and easier because
consenting users can easily and quickly run each other's programs.

In VMS, there is another executable file type besides .exe
files: .com files which are run by an interpreter.

Also, viruses can be written to infect ascii source files such as C
programs.

These viruses would probably be caught early, because someone would notice
lines of code in their program that they wouldn't recognize.  But many
others wouldn't notice right away.  Especially if it only infected
large source files.

I could go on and on, but I don't want to take up everyones time!

Rich -
	I'm glad you find VE useful, I certainly spend enough time
keeping it up to date.

	For those of you looking for copies, I upload it to GEnie,
CompuServe, and several Chicago BBSs.  John Norstad is also kind
enough to forward a copy to info-mac and comp.binaries.mac.  Of
course from these locations it propagates like mad (one of the BBSs
is a FIDO Node); you can probably locate it on any reasonable Mac
archive. (I've seen a copy in an archive listing fron the UK!)

	Of course you'll want to check to see if you have the latest
version (currently Apr. 5, 1990).  This is determined by the date on
the discalimer card.

	If you absolutely can't get it any other way, send me $2.50
or a disk at the mailing address above, and I'll get a copy to you
(although I don't promise to be speedy, I try my best :-)
