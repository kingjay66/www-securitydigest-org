Re: *really* fail-safe virus protection

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Isn't the power to erase-and-recreate functionally the same as the
power to alter?  If something has munged an executable by reading it
in, erasing it, and re-creating it, the relevant consequences will
be just the same as if it had directly patched it on disk, yesno?
Are there operating systems that allow you to mark files as subject
to erase-and-recreate, but not subject to zap-in-place?  (That's
just a curiousity question; a virus can happily use either method.)

The power to erase-X-and-then-rename-Y-to-X is another functional
equivalent to bytewise write access...

Well, a virus that infected the software while it was on someone
else's machine could decide to go off (because of the date or
whatever) and mess with your data files (which can't be readonly, in
general?).  But it's quite true that a virus can't spread to your
programs if they're all on a readonly medium whenever the virus has a
chance to be in control.

Why are only one-time runs interesting, though?   Most software gets run
more than once.   If you really do power down the machine before ever
flipping the write-protect switch off, and only run utterly trusted
software in that state, you're quite safe.   Utterly trusted software
is hard to come by, though!   *8)   If a virus ever gets to run while
the switch is off, or is ever still around in memory or whatever while
the switch is off, you're no longer protected.   No amount of testing
can reliably determine that a program deserves to be utterly trusted;
viruses can spread as rarely as they like (the original carrier of the
DataCrime had a month or so's delay before it started spreading).

This isn't to say that a write-prot switch for the hard disk is a
bad idea; if I got along better with hardware, I'd put one in myself.
But I'd suggest using it along with other anti-virus measures
(scanners, modification detectors, backups, etc), and not relying on it
exclusively.  I don't think it's *the* solution to the problem...

DC

P.S. The ultimate solution is of course John McAfee's "spackle".
     But it's difficult to get much actual use out of a
     properly-spackled computer, unless you have a door you want
     held open...

Did anyone think of checking for a batch file called 123.BAT on this
system?  Or looking around on the disk with Norton Utilities (or some
such) to try and locate the file that contained some of the text that
was displayed.

This sounds more like a the type of non-damaging pranks I've played
(and have had played on me) than a a virus/worm/Trojan-horse.
Unfortunately, since the disk was wiped, we will probably never know.

WARNING!  Although TTL logic floats high when open, it can (and often
will) go low for a few microseconds (due to cross talk on the chip?).
I've been burned a few times when I thought some signal would float
high. I highly recommend that you use a pullup resistor to +5V (if you
don't already have one).  The value of the resistor would depend on
the drive strength of the chip on the other side of the switch.  5000
ohms will work for most cases: chips with an IOL MIN of 1 mA or more.

I would hate to see the write signal go low even for just a micro second
when the head is over some random part of my disk!  It may only happen
on rare occasions, such as when someone turns on a heavy appliance on
the same circuit.  It may only affect 1 bit (or none).

Well, back to my origional misconception about Amigas and using EPROMs.
Even though they don't (yet), how much more of an undertaking, and how
much would it boost the cost, to start incorporating EPROMs into future
hardware for OS.  We have the technology, why not start using it?

EPROMs, with an external switch, Could enable you to install a new
versions/updates/bug fixes without a major kinipshin by owners.  Again,
this makes the assumption that the distribution diskettes are clean.
Another limitation would be the amount of writes you were able to do
before frying the EPROM chip; I dont know hardware that well, so I have
no idea what a reasonable estimate would be.

Amiga appears to have its act together more than most PC/compatibles and
Macs in that at least the low-level boot is done in ROM.  Hopefully they
will implement standard libs/handlers in the same way.  What about interrupt
vectors too?  I dont personally see any reason for modifying standard OS
interrupts (except with version updates); reserved/user programmable vectors,
if needed, can still be implemented the old way. Hmmmmmmmmmm

Subject: Mainframe viruses

David Chess:
>...viruses don't have to get around security systems to spread; they
>spread by writing to objects that they are authorized to write to.

Let me restate my point:  properly implemented and audited security
systems tend to *restrict* the spread of viruses.  I'll concede that
security systems alone don't do the trick; you have to have people
who use the mainframe system educated on how to protect themselves
from being tromped on by others.  This, of course, does not prevent
them from stepping on themselves, but if they cannot write to another
persons (or the systems) object libraries, he cannot spread the virus
to someone else, can he?  Mainframes use something that most pc-type
architectures dont--protected memory.

When a task enters the system under MVS or VM, the OS sets up an
address space bounded in memory for that task (batch job, TSO user,
etc.)  That address space cannot be modified by other address spaces
nor can it modify other address spaces (except for normal operator
commands like display, cancel, etc).  Forget security subsystems for
the moment, this is supported solely by the OS.  Under this type of
system, there is *no way* for a normal address space, regardless of
whether he is a "super-user", security id, or whatever, to even
address outside of his own address space.  The system maintains a set
of page tables, and all of your addressable storage is maintained
through these tables.  They can only be modified through the system.
If you need more memory, the system grabs more (if available), and
sets up another pagetable entry for you.  When your task terminates,
the system deletes all of your entries, and returns all your memory to
the free memory pool.  None of this can be accessed directly by the
user, period.  There is no way for viral code to get control of system
functions in this way.  Now there are some special utilities out there
that run under the OS that allow you to view or modify global storage
areas, but these should be (and are at our installation) monitored for
such activity.  The only other way to introduce viral code into the
system is to have system programmer abilities and access to make
changes to the system load libraries.  Not an easy task.  Now, as Dave
and others have pointed out, this type of knowledge is limited
comparative to PCs, and the casual hacker is discouraged from such
targets.  Those that do have the ability and would be using it for
dastardly ends, once caught would find themselves without the second
necessary element--access.

With regard to file copying, copy utility programs aren't
other-modifying in the sense that I get from your posting, Dave.  As
far as a copy utility is concerned, all you're copying is pure text.
A copy program don't know the difference between data and object, it
just copies bytes from file1 to file2.  When invoked, it makes a call
to the system to allocate file2, then it writes.  When it's done, both
files are closed, and the program terminates.  Now on a PC,
object/data distinctions are easy (*.COM, *.EXE vs. *.DAT, *.DBF).  On
MVS and the like, that distinction doesn't exist.  The only time the
system knows the difference between the two is when it's told to
EXECute a file.  If it's not object or macro or script langauage,
you'll know almost immediately.  VM is different from MVS in that the
MODULE and EXEC filetypes still exist to make things easy for you.
Now, you could copy a program that contains a virus to another file,
but again, whether you you infect someone else in this manner depends
on what accesses are granted through your security subsystem.

Again, mail viruses are a different story altogether.  And I agree
with the many recent postings about script viruses being a "fertile
breeding ground".  But whether that breeding ground exists beyond the
single user is dependent on the file sharing (e.g., through mailings)
between users (a Christmas tree, neat, huh?) and accesses granted
throughout the system.

I hope this answer doesn't insult your intelligence, but if you're
using a system (or control panel) more than a year old you've got the
problem.  There was one setting of the keyboard- fastest repeat rate,
shortest delay until repeat, I think- that would take any keypress and
repeat it for as long at is was held down.  That plus a sticky key
could do it.

Course I could be wrong.

The new PC Virus that Don Kazem writes about in Vol 3 Issue 82 is a

act as if it is formating all hard drives in the affected system.  To
the best of my knowledge it does no harm to anything except the
onwer's peace of mind and general condition of his/her heart for a
brief period of time.  I have a copy of the program if anyone is

>From:    Don Kazem <DKAZEM@NAS.BITNET>

I received a call today from one of the local chain food stores about
what could be a new virus. Since they have no connection to the
network, I offered to post this.

A user was running Lotus (by invoking 123.exe), and after a file
retrieve, the virus was triggered. The following message was
displayed: (The spelling errors are the same as they appeared).

(edited out)

After a while, the words "JUST KIDDING" appeared, and everything went
back to normal. Although, it appeared as though there was no damage,
they ran Wipedisk, and installed everything from the original disks.

They ran SCAN61 both before and after reinstalling the software, and
SCAN did not find anything.

The have a backup of the hard disk, before they ran Wipedisk, and are
willing to forward copies of their executables to researchers (lawyers
permitting).

Has anyone heard of this?

Subject: Public Domain/Shareware Anti-Virus Tools for IBM PC

I have a couple of questions about Public Domain or Shareware anti-
virus software.

1. I'm confused about the John McAfee product line ... is it share-
   ware or not? As you can see, I'm from an Australian University and
   we are interested in using SCANRES (/VSHIELD) on an institution-
   wide basis.

   Information we have received from McAfee Associates,
   suggests we need to buy a site/ corporate licence costing $5,925
   (US) for say 500 copies (that's about $7,400 to us down under).

   A recent posting forwarded by Alan Roberts from John McAfee talks
   about 'changes to the SCAN shareware product line'.

   So, do we need a SCANRES license or is it shareware, am I
   talking about two sets of different products or is the price
   above the actual shareware price or what? If we need a
   license, are we talking a site license or corporate license for
   a multi-campus educational institution?

2. Are there any other public domain/ shareware products similar to
   SCANRES/ VSHIELD we should look at?

3. Finally, we're running Novell PC networks. What virus
   protection software are people using in this area?

   Again, McAfee Associates have NETSCAN for $2,000 (flat fee)
   according to their product listing. Can anyone help with more
   information about this? Do you need to buy a copy of NETSCAN for
   each network you want to protect?

   Are there any other anti-virus tools we should be looking at
   for Novell PC networks?

Any information at all on any of the above would be greatly
appreciated. If there is enough interest, I'd be only too happy
to summarise for the net.

Hi out there,

we found the 1704 virus version B at RHRZ Bonn, Germany. We got it
from a person who learned SPSS PC+ in our pool. The infection software
was MIPS.COM, a program what shows the speed of the computer. He give
it to the course leader and he give it round in our computing center.
Because of the age of the virus i didn't found any comments to it. The
infection was 10 month ago, and we didn't know it. Some machines,
where public domain software was tested, were clean. They are clean
yet. I tried McAfee's CLEANP61 to kill the virus out of the software
packages without destroying them, but the software didn't run. I
think, i make an error, but i there is somebody else, whop know this
problem, please describe it.

Well, actually the wire needn't be so very short for a ST506 cable.
The specs say the total cable length may be 3m (=10 ft), and you don't
have to worry about EMI (electro magnetic interference) because the
actual write gate signal doesn't carry such high frequencies.
