I would have to go back and research it, but I beleive that some of
the people involved in the investigation of the Morris worm went
looking for people who knew about these "well-known" holes, but could
only find a few (less than a dozen) who knew about them *before* the
Morris worm took advantage of it.  I don't think that a dozen people
on the whole entire Internet makes for "well-known".

Subject: SAM and Garfield (Mac)

For SAM 2.0 users,

A new virus has recently been discovered. It is called Garfield (or
MDEF by some). It only attempts to propagate itself. It can cause some
unexpected behavior however, especially with menus (see below). If you
happen to run across the Garfield with SAM 2.0, you can expect to see
the following.

1) If you are running in advanced level, or custom level with
change/add code resource checked on, SAM will alert you to Garfield's
attempt to change/add MDEF resources within applications and the
System file when Garfield is trying to spread itself. Denying these
attempts with SAM keeps the infection from spreading. However,
Garfield can modify the system file's menu definition procedure ID.
Though the infection doesn't spread, the result may be odd menu
behavior on some Macintoshes. The symptom to look for is menus that
don't pop-down when clicked on. The simplest solution to this is to
replace the system file with a new copy.

2) SAM Virus Clinic will also alert you to a checksum change to any
infected files if you have turned on checksumming in the Virus Clinic
scans.

3) You can configure SAM (both Virus Clinic and Intercept) to find
Garfield during scans and application launches with the new virus
definition feature.  Using the Add Virus Definition option in Virus
Clinic, create a new definition with these fields:

     Virus Name:   Garfield
  Resource Type:   MDEF
    Resource ID:   0
  Resource Size:   314
  Search String:   2F3C434F44454267A9A0    (hexadecimal)
  String Offset:   42

You can then add this definition to both Virus Clinic and SAM Intercept.

Subject: Re: Military Virus and SciFi books

Considering the complexity of viruses already being produced and their
possible use as weapons, it may be worth considering some of the problems
that we could see in the future.
Especially linked to virtual worlds:
Users could be locked in their environment unable to move - like Marcel
Marceaux?  |8-)
Or even a poltergeist moving objects around.

Any other suggestions ideas on what the programmer could come up against
in an uncertain future.

Regarding viruses, especially on UNIX systems, anyone on this forum who hasn't
read Ken Thompson's "On Trusting Trust," should drop everything and read it.
It points out the need to protect such system utilities as the C compiler.

It appeared in the Communications of the ACM, August 1984, and was also reis-
sued in UNIX Review this year, but I don't remember which month.

Subject: SCANRES question (PC)

Sorry if this is in the wrong group, but I have a question regarding
the virus scanner 'scanres' for the pc.  I am a software tech for our
PC lab here at Cal Poly, and I need to be able to 'deinstall' scanres
from memory, so that a big memory hog application can run.  I also
need to be able to reinstall it without running through the scans
again. (BTW - These are not my requirements, my boss is insisting that
I keep the program memory resident except for the time that the huge
application is running.)

sooooo, could anyone out there help me with what the command line
options are for scanres.  I would read the manual, except someone here
(not me) has lost them.  Thanks in advance for any help!

Subject: MDEF virus (MAC) discovered at Cornell University

Folks and netters,

I am posting this for a colleague who is the chief virus fighter
here at Cornell University. PLEASE, do not use followup. His
address and info are below:

Tom Young
Assistant Director of Workstation Resources
Cornell Information Technologies
220 CCC/Garden Ave
Cornell University
Ithaca, NY 14853
E-MAIL: XMU@CORNELLA.CIT.CORNELL.EDU

He is an AVID e-mailer so please feel free to contact him directly.
Thanks.

   We have detected what I believe to be a new Macintosh virus.  This
virus can be referred to as the MDEF or Garfield virus, for reasons
that will become clear below.  I'm passing along all that I have
verified about the virus.  Some local folks are working on further
analysis, and I will be sending samples of this virus to some of the
national anti-virus experts.

   This virus replaces the System file's native MDEF resource with a
new resource, named Garfield.  MDEF is a resource that is part of the
Mac's menu generation system.  The original MDEF resource is apparently
retained but given an ID of 5378; the substitute resource has the
normal ID of zero.  This new "Garfield" MDEF resource will propagate to
application files, and an infected application file can spread the virus
to a fresh System file.  The viral MDEF resource will also attach itself
to the Finder.
   After some period of time or after some set of actions, the viral
MDEF resource will delete itself from the System, resulting in the loss
of all menus generated by the System.  We have not yet tracked down the
details of the conditions under which this happens.

   The Vaccine program will successfully block an infection.  When
an application is launched, Vaccine will display a message asking if
you wish to grant permission to add an MDEF resource.  If you see this
message, you have the new virus.
   If you use the Virus Detective DA, you can add the following two
search strings to check for the new virus:
     Resource MDEF & Name "Garfield"
     Resource MDEF & ID = 5378
Using these two search strings, you should be able to scan your disks
for an infection.
   Disinfectant WILL NOT find this virus when it scans a disk.  This
is a new virus that this anti-virus program doesn't know about.

   At present, there is no software that will automatically remove
this virus.  The simplest solution is to replace all files that check
positive for an infection, and then use Virus Detective to rescan for
any signs of the virus.  More sophisticated remedies will certainly
be developed in the near future.

   It may be possible to repair an infection by (1) deleting the
"Garfield" resource from the System and changing the ID of the MDEF
resource that remains from 5378 to zero; (2) simply deleting the
"Garfield" resource from all other files in which it is found.  There
is no guarantee this will work, and it should only be attempted by
the technically venturesome.

5/17--

   The MDEF/Garfield virus has now been analyzed by several of the
major anti-virus experts in the country.  It does not appear to be a
very sophisticated virus.  Its only explicit malignant effect is that
the system-generated menu structure may fail -- when you click on the
menu bar, no menu drops down.  I would caution, however, that the
final verdict is still not in.
   It has been verified that this virus will not spread on some con-
figurations of newer hardware and system software, for instance a
Mac IIci running System 6.0.5.
   Two of the major commercial anti-virus developers updated their
software today for this new virus:  Virex and Symantec AntiVirus for
the Macintosh (SAM).  They will be notifying registered owners of
these packages and shipping updates immediately.  An update to the
popular freeware Disinfectant program should be ready by Friday
evening or Saturday.
   The investigators have confirmed that the method for manual removal
of the virus outlined in my previous mail file is effective.  One
can delete the "Garfield" MDEF resources from system files and
applications, and change the ID of the MDEF resource that remains in
the System file from 5378 back to zero.  This is a solution only for
people who are comfortable with ResEdit (VirusDectective also provides
tools for this).  For most people, the more reasonable approach is to
delete the infected files and replace them with clean copies from one's
master disks.

it's been done.  at the Winter '89 Usenex conference in san diego,
Tom Duff presented a paper entitled "Viral Attacks on UNIX System
Security".  he built a virus somewhat weaker than the one described
above; it would only insert itself in the extra space at the end
of an executable, if there was sufficient space between the end
of the executable and the next 512 byte block boundary.  if would
only infect files in the current directory.

he loosed the thing inside AT&T as an experiment to see how well such
a weak virus would spread, and how it could be started.  (he started the
infection by adding an infected copy of "echo" to some public directories
he had write access too).

the most interesting aspect of this was that it got picked up in
an automated distribution of a new version of "wc" to 45
local machines, at which time the infection really took off.  it
caused some particular problems on a "secure" unix that was
being developed, since the kernel detected the attempts of the
virus to propagate, and killed the virus.  unfortunately, it had
by then gotten imbedded in cc, as, and all the other important
utilites as a result of "big make" performed with the security
checks turned off.

it's an interesting paper; one worth reading, since it talks
about means of prevention, and generally good security practice
on Unix machines.

Hi there;
        I never though I would see this day, but I just got a virus alert on
the lab's PC." Stoned Virus detected ". I have no previous experience nor
research into this field and I thought I could get away from it by being
careful. I was, someone wasn't.
        Going straight to the point. " WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I SUPPOSE TO DO!"
 ... --- ... --- ... --- ... ---

        1. Can I entirely kill the virus?
        2. How does it spread?

I know this list has been around and the answers have probably been repeated
a million times. I just need to know where to search. Thanks.

Subject: Bug in F-PROT (PC)

An error has been discovered in version 1.09 of F-PROT.  It seems that
the F-DISINF program is not able to remove the 'Stoned' virus from
hard disks, although it will remove it from diskettes.

The F-SYSCHK program will find the virus in memory, and F-DRIVER will
stop it.

The problem has now been fixed and a corrected F-DISINF program will
be sent to everybody on my mailing list later today.

Special thanks to Mickey Waxman (University of Kansas) for his
assistance in locating and removing the problem.

The Toothless virus reported in Bulgaria turned out to be identical to

W13 should therefore be classified as a variant of Vienna.

DOCTOR   QUICK!   Virus Doctor for the Eddie Virus   Version 2.01    10-31-89
Copyright (c) 1988-89 Dark Avenger.  All rights reserved.  DOCTOR /? for help

 It may be of interest to you to know that Eddie (also known as "Dark Avenger")
is the most widespread virus in Bulgaria for the time being.  However, I have
information that Eddie is well-known in USA, W. Germany and USSR too.

 I started writing the virus in early September 1988.  In those times there
were no any viruses written in Bulgaria, so I decided to write the first
Bulgarian virus.  There were some different Eddie's versions:

    VERSION 1.0, 31-OCT-1988
 This version established the most important features of the Eddie virus.
Staying resident into high end of memory, it was infecting .COM and .EXE
files, but only when executing them.  INT 13 hadn't been handled in any way.
This version was damaging infected files only, rather than infected disks.
Also, there weren't any messages in it (I still wasn't choosed a name for it).

   VERSION 1.1, 16-DEC-1988
 In December I've decided to enchance the virus.  This version could infect
files during their opening.  For that reason, a read buffer was allocated in
high end of memory, rather than using DOS function 48h when needed.  The disk
was destroyed instead of the infected files.

                                 Press <Enter>
   VERSION 1.2, 19-DEC-1988
 This added a new feature that causes (for example) compiled programs to be
infected at once if the virus is resident.  Also, the "Eddie lives..." message
was added (can you guess why exactly "Eddie"?)

   VERSION 1.31, 3-JAN-1989
 This became the most common version of Eddie. A code was added to find the
INT 13 rom-vector on many popular XT's and AT's.  Also, other messages were
added so its length would be exactly 1800 bytes.  There was a subsequent,
1.32 version (19-JAN-1989), which added self-checksum and other interesting
features that was abandoned because it was extremely buggy.

 In early March 1989 version 1.31 was called into existence and started to live
its own life to all engineers' and other suckers' terror.  And, the last

   VERSION 1.4, 17-OCT-1989
 This was a bugfix for version 1.31, and added some interesting new features.
Support has been added for DOS 2.x and DOS 4.x.  For further information about
this (the most terrible) version, and to learn how to find out a program author
by its code, or why virus-writers are still not dead, contact Mr. Vesselin
Bontchev (All Rights Reserved).

 So, never say die!  Eddie lives on and on and on...  Up the irons!
