Re: Antivirus viruses

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

	Frankly the idea is abhorrent to me. For one reason, such a
program must, by definition be constantly modifying files and would
make any effective configuration management impossible. Secondly,
there are a number of programs (VolksWriter comes to mind) using
overlays that cannot function properly with any extra appendages.

	We already have "hunter-killer" programs (the McAfee utilities
come to mind) that are initiated by the user and quit when told. Other
programs are available which become resident and keep watch on system
activities (e.g. Virus-Safe). Most are based on a stable environment
from which deviations can be detected.

	Mature detection routines are still mixed into two camps:
virsu spotters that work by viral signature analysis, and exception
spotters that detect deviations from a known environment. While both
have their pros & cons, I suspect that the final product will either
be #2 or a synthesis of both. For obvious reasons any viral activity,
even of a benign nature, would make this impossible.

	While it is certainly possible that an adaptive expert system
might be developed that would be essentially virus-proof, it would
also be a troubleshooting nightmare. We must remember that a solution
must be appropriate for 50 million uneducated users who wish the PC to
be a tool, not for the "experts" who can pull apart a 160k .EXE and
determine its function.  Unfortunately, the users for whom a global
solution is necessary are unlikely to participate in this forum.
(personal opinion)

	One further opinion: some people have commented that the 4096
is not reponsible for crosslinking files and that users cause the
problems when they use CHKDSK/F. Sounds like something a politician
would say.

How about this scenario: a slow fuse/fast cloning virus that pretends
to be an antivirus. It could be quite widespread before the bombs
start going off, and meantime the users are lulled into a false sense
of security. And a real antivirus virus that comes into this pool of
users would be ignored (the "crying wolf" effect).

  For the most part, I agree with Scott; however, the antiviruses
we've been discussing (which present an alert box and options) will
themselves be targets.  That is, if some one releases an antivirus
(call it VANTIV) which computer users become familiar with, then the
next malicious virus will impersonate VANTIV.  Users will lose trust
in VANTIV and stop using it (losing the benefits); the author of
VANTIV could be blamed for the effects of the impersonator (do we call
this a "trojan virus"?)
  Rather than this scenario, I suggest a "quiet" antivirus. (No
flames, yet; please read on!)  Let's split computer users into two
groups; there are those who are fairly "virus aware", literate users
who check every new disk (most of us on this list). The second group
is by far the majority; they know viruses exist, but only learn much
about them *after* becoming infected, sometimes long after!
  I doubt anyone in the former group would welcome an antivirus, and
the majority would catch and kill it before infection.  I certainly
wouldn't welcome this critter on my machine, which I know to be clean!
However, I might write such a virus, and even distribute it "on the
sly".  I assume that those who don't need it won't get it (having
killed it first), and those who do are quite possibly already infected
(this campus is rife with nVir B).
  As far as the morality/ethics question, I have no problems with this
idea; there's no reason you can't help someone without their
knowledge!
  This entire scenario makes one possibly large assumption: that this
"antivirus virus" is itself not too virulent, is well programmed in
detection, eradication, and even prevention, and is generally
well-behaved.  Jo My musings herein are not necessarily endorsed by
the University of Alaska And when this thing does show up, I didn't

Subject: Reasons anti-virus viruses are bad

Assuming that your "nice" virus 1) works properly, 2) always asks
before doing anything, and 3) removes itself after doing its function,
there are still reasons why it's a bad idea.

1) This is a masterly set-up for a Trojan horse. Looks just like the
   "Nice Guy" virus, but it does (pick the nasty of your choice) instead.
2) Unforseen circumstances. New hardware, new versions of an operating
   system, etc., could cause bad things to happen.
3) Bugs. There will always be bugs.
4) No way to "guarantee a clean copy" - the current weak spot in all
   anti-virals. In the immortal works of Roseanne Roseannadanna, "You
   don't know *where* it's been!"
5) Mac virus clones have proved that there are people capable of taking
   a working virus and changing it. No doubt this would be done (see (1)).

One should not forget ram shadowing of the bios.  It is a simple
matter to determine whether this is in effect attempt to alter a byt
in the bios area, and see if it took.  If so, then overlay one of the
known entry points (most bioses attempt to be IBM compatabile, right
down to the entry points in the rom), and patch part of the bios.  Now
you are below DOS, below the BIOS interface, below the IRQ's etc.

Good point.  This is a fertile breeding ground, imagine a large virus,
that stuffs it'self up there, and then pages back and forth by
changing the LIM memory driver, so that interrupts to it pass control
to the virus.  Since LIM drivers are easy to access, live in ram, it
would be no big deal to patch the actual code, and not touch the
interrupt vectors.  The same goes double for device drivers.  Suppose
a device driver that does some nice thing, like fix the @#$%@$#% daily
rollover bug in dos.  The driver perhaps unpacks a bit of nasty that
goes to work at midnight...

I have thought about the problem too.

1) It can never be nice or ethical to spread a virus, no matter if it
is a "good" or a "bad" virus. Viruses interfere with computer
systems, spread without users' consent and modify executables. There
is simply too much risk involved here. Let's assume an example: A
"good" virus that removes 40 other viruses is developed under DOS
3.x. The author tests it and it works fine. The virus uses DOS
interrupts 25h and 26h to perform absolute disk reads/writes. DOS 4.x
appears: Suddenly, every program infected with this 'good' virus
crashes.... No, I can live without 'good' viruses interfering with my
work... Viruses that are 'on their way' can not be updated to reflect
changes in the operating system :-(

2) I agree. There is too much secrecy when it comes to discussing
algorithms. If anyone has a knowledge of assembler programming,
TechRef documentation and some in-depth DOS book (that deals with
MCBs, undocumented functions, advanced TSR and disk programming etc.)
he can write a Stealth virus in a very short time.

3) I agree. Imagine a virus that asks you to 'innoculate' all your
diskettes, infects and encrypts each and every of your executables
and 14 days after you "protected" all your files, none of them work
any longer... :-(

Also, in the Amiga world we have the situation that killer viruses
are hunting down other viruses. From what I have been told, the
situation is pretty bad there...

     In issue 143, Scott Erickson stated that "I don't see any
additional danger the average user is put into with the innovation of
antiviruses...."  I would agree that some of his points have merit,
but I would like to give one example of how a phony antivirus could
pose a greater danger than a "standard" virus.
     Many people using Macintoshes now employ some sort of resident
virus blocker such as Vaccine or Disinfectant.  These types of
utilities are designed to identify known viruses and to BLOCK
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.  Many of these have an option to allow this kind
of activity to certain programs (compilers, etc).  If a virus writer
wanted an easy way to get around these programs, all he or she would
need to do is to have the virus identify itself as an antivirus, and
then ask the user to set his or her virus protection to allow the
virus in.  After a few days, weeks, or months, the seemingly helpful
antivirus would then reveal its true colors.
     It is certainly easier for a virus writer to put in some message
like the one above (perhaps one which only reveals itself if the virus
detects something like Disinfectant) than for the person to design a
virus to get around the protection.

Antivirus viruses could be dangerous in at least two ways:

1.  Think about a user who has an antivirus program monitoring disk
reads and writes.  If an ordinary virus tries to propagate, the
monitoring program stops it and warns the user, but if the virus asks
for permission and gets it, the user has no reason for getting
suspicious about its virus-like behaviour.  Of course, the virus would
do the damage only after a long time in order to be able to multiply
before being caught.
    Now the danger of Trojan horses is nothing new.  This would be
just another flavour of them, having an effective method of getting
widely distributed.

2.  A virus performs something quite dangerous when propagating: it
modifies another program automatically.  Therefore minor programming
bugs in a genuine benevolent antivirus virus could destroy programs or
other valuable data more easily than an ordinary program.  I think
there are several examples of viruses which apparently try to
propagate only without causing any harm but which hang the system
quite frequently in some circumstances.
    This is the more serious objection to antivirus viruses of these
two, I think.
           
I would suggest that the potential author of an antivirus virus should
write an ordinary antivirus program, with a handy _explicit_ Copy Self
command, and include instructions for making the program run
automatically at bootstrap or something like that.  It would require a
bit more effort on the user's part, but IMHO the increased safety
would outweigh the little loss of convenience.
