VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: scan60 (PC)

I tried SCAN60 on the virus-infected version of CHKDSK which was
mailed to the VALERT list; SCAN did not detect the infection.  I have
not peersonally verified that the file contained a virus, but a
partial disassembly with a debugger showed that the file has been
modified, and past messages on this list have indicated that a virus
was found in this file.

Unfortunately, viruses do not depend on this hardware model; viruses
can spread in any system that allows both programming and information
sharing, regardless of whether or not programs have direct access to
the hardware, whether or not the system is assumed to be single-user,
and so on.  See various papers by Fred Cohen on the subject.  As long
as (roughly) some programs sometimes have write-access to some other
programs, viruses can spread.

Subject: New files on MIBSRV (PC)

The following files have been placed on MIBSRV.MIB.ENG.UA.EDU (130.160.20.80)
for anonymous FTP in the directory pub/ibm-antivirus.

SCANV61.ZIP  - McAfee's SCAN 3.1V61, scans for 85 virii.  (update)
SCANRS61.ZIP - McAfee's tsr SCAN 1.4V61                      "
NETSCN61.ZIP - McAfee's NETSCAN V61                          "
CLEANP61.ZIP - McAfee's CLEAN UP program                     "

AVS214.ZIP    -  AVSEARCH - Virus Search Program V2.14 - Scan for 75 virii.
DETECT31.ZIP  -  The Detective R3.1.  File tracking/virus detector.
                 Can be used on Novell Networks. (update)
EXPEL11.ZIP   -  EXPEL V1.1 by Toltech.  Virus control device that sample/
                 track options.
HACKTHES.ZIP  -  A thesis paper on the Computer Underground.  Text includes
                 information on hackers, pirates, phreakers, etc.
HACKER.THESES -  Same as above, but not ZIPed (generic ascii text file)

Comments:  EXPEL11's virus tracker/extracter looks interesting.  Since I
don't like to keep a live virus around, I really don't know how effective
it is.  Perhaps a virus guru can give us a better opinion of this particular
option of this program?

The SCAN series of programs were download directly from McAfee's BBS on
4/2/90 at 10:30pm.  SCANV60 will remain on MIBSRV until 4/7/90 in case
requests are pending at BITFTP@PUCC.  The files were reZIPed using the
- -ex option of PKZIP for maximun compression.

NOTE:  A user has written "Why are the versions of SCAN on MIBSRV,
Simtel20 and (add your favorite BBS) different in size when they both say they
get files from Homebase?"  They have not been ZIPed for maximun compression
(ie, PKZIP -ex -a (zipname) *.*).  With PKZIP, you can have 4 levels of
compression.  Level 1 makes a ZIP file *fast* but doesn't compress it very
much.  Level 4 takes the longest to make a ZIP file, but does max compression.
So you could actually ZIP the same files 4 times and get 4 different ZIP sizes.

If your worried about McAfee's files, just run his VALIDATE program on them.
If the two generated numbers match whats posted on his board (or in the docs),
then the files are good copies.

  It was possible to eradicate smallpox because three conditions existed.
        1) Smallpox had only one host (humans).
        2) Smallpox had only one vector (humans).
        3) Smallpox could not survive outside of a host.
  To eradicate smallpox one (only) had to be assured that no human carried the
disease. WHO has accomplished this.  Currently the only copies of the smallpox
virus is in the hands of national biological weapons researchers and perhaps
some health workers.  Assuming that no one is stupid enough to release smallpox
from the labs, smallpox will never again show up in the human population.
However, other viruses will; e.g. cow-pox and AIDS.

  The same conditions do not hold true for any computer virus.  Take WDEF
for instance.  We could 'immunize' all current Mac's with Gatekeeper's Aid.
This would eliminate all active occurrences of WDEF.  However WDEF can lay
dormant on a floppy.  So when the world thinks that is safe from WDEF and stops
inoculating (as we have with smallpox) it would only take one floppy that was
hidden in someone's desk to re-infect the community all over again.

  In all probability, there will be someone to come along and write another
virus to get around our immunization program anyway.  So taking the such
draconian measures, as WHO did in the 60's and 70's for smallpox, would be
a waste of time for computer viruses.  Besides the damage is pretty slight,
when you compare it to smallpox.

  Perhaps my real point should be this

        Computer viruses are not the same thing as biological viruses.

They both have the same word in them (virus), but then so do boardroom
and bathroom.  We may see similarities between the two, but they are
really quite different.  We shouldn't push the analogy too far.  What
would we say to the janitor who says "I clean the bathroom with this
toilet cleaner, the boardroom and bathroom are both rooms, so I'll
clean the leather seats in the boardroom with this toilet scrubber."
Just because words have the same root, doesn't make them the same
thing.

Subject: Request for Anit-Viral Software (Amiga)

I am looking for an anti-viral program like the Macintosh Vaccine/GateKeeper
programs for the Amiga.  I am also looking for an anti-viral program that will
check my hard drive for viruses on programs that I download directly to it.

I am currently running the most recent version of VirusX but it does not seem
to scan my hard drive.  So far I am hoping that the large FTP archives are
clean and merely backing up regularly.  I know this isn't particuarly safe but
I really do not want to recopy everything to a floppy so that VirusX will look
at it.  Do I have VirusX misconfigured?  The disk checked count does not
indicate that it is checking hd0:.

Thank you for any information.  I will post a synopsis of any information I get
on comp.sys.amiga.

Subject: Anti-viral software for PC

I am putting together a diskette of anti-viral software for
distribution to faculty, staff and students at the University of
Calgary.  Since I haven't had much experience with virus attacks I
would appreciate any feedback on the pros and cons of the many
programs for fighting viruses.  I am looking for a program or a
collection of programs that will be best suited for distribution for a
wide variety of system configurations and levels of user expertise.

Subject: Small Pox

Okay, Okay.....
I was wrong, perhaps Small Pox is not a good example of a virus treatment
method.  However the idea of taking a strong aproach to elimination  and
a strong aproach to treatment and prevention such as the World Health Org.
did twords Small Pox I feel is still an effective method of dealing with
a computer virus problem.
