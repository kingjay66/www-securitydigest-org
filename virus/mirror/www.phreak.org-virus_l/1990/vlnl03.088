Subject: Re: Protection against writing to executables...

Some of the comments made recently about what can and can't be done
under the scrutiny of an operating system or add-on security package may
be irrelevant if the virus author ignores the O/S and writes directly to
the disk controller hardware.  This is still possible in a lot of
systems out there today, though one hopes that this will soon change.

Subject: FSHIELD (PC)

       There are many programs that can detect
     presence of unknown viruses, such as FluShot+, SCAN
     B.R.M's VirAlarm, and Turbo Anti-Virus. These
     programs have the ability to detect any change in a file.
     This method has proved itself in identifying unknown
     viruses. However, it has a few disadvantages; The check
     process is very time consuming, making it uncomfortable to
     work with as often as needed. The check process needs the
     antivirus, and therefore makes the whole thing usable only
     on one machine. But the major disadvantage, is that these
     programs can only detect viruses, and they cannot remove the
     viruses they detect. FShield, however, was designed to
     overcome these disadvantages; The virus check is done
     on-line, and takes almost no time; A protected file contains
     a virus protective shell within itself, that transparently
     performs an integrity check when the file is run, and is
     thus fully mobile, and can be copied without the operating
     system's COPY command. The most important feature of
     FShield, however, is its ability to remove viruses that
     were not yet discovered. In other words, FShield protected
     software will identify and remove any viral infection,
     without the user having to do anything about it!

Subject: Re: Mainframe viruses

After some reflection and conversation with an MVS guru (my supervisor),
I'd like to address some points that have been raised in recent discussion.

Kelly Goen points out that bypassing APF (Authorized Program Facility) on
MVS and operating in excp=vr (a way to do direct IO, bypassing the OS, and
thus the security system) is a way of spreading viruses.  While this is
one way of doing it (certainly not an easy way), it is not necessary to
use either of these.  There are ways of staying within APF and getting
into supervisor state (key 0) and doing whatever you want.  Some installations
have special service calls that will do this for you.  All we need is a vendor
(or an employee from within) who is unhappy with something and out to get
someone for it.  A vendor product that needs an SVC, usermod, or exit
(interface to the system) has the potential to have bad code placed in it.

Luckily, there are several factors that discourage this sort of thing from
happening.  As Dave Chess pointed out origionally, some of them are social.
One big reason I can think of is that mainframe programmers, unlike the PC
programmer, is making a living at writing code.  S/he is not usually willing
to jeopardize that career for the sake of unleashing a nasty.  With PCers,
there is more of a "casual user" mentality.  Most of the people at the
mainframe level who work with viruses are more likely to create them as a
way of testing the security system or look at ways to prevent them as opposed
to unleashing one for fun or malice.

Now, BNDL (I've never hear of this one, do you perhaps mean BLDL?), and STOW
macros can indeed be used to modify partitioned dataset (PDS) library members
where code is kept.  In fact, they are by system utilities (such as IEBUPDTE).
Although, I don't get how manipulating page tables is equivalent to altering
executable images....page tables themselves are nothing more than pointers
to where pages are in memory (roughly analogous to a pc segment table,
I think).  To the best of my knowledge, a page table contains no executable
code whatsoever.  You can also disassemble system programs (editors, copy
utilities, etc) *if* you happen to have a utility to do such or have the
extreme patience to do so by hand, and figure out how they work and how
to get a bug into them.  (I've also never heard of IEHONESTY; not to mention
pds member names are limited to 8 characters).  Using SMP/E or other similar
system generation/modification products is an open avenue to spreading
infections, but this gets back to Jim Molini's point of keeping system/security
logs of what's happening in the system.  If you have the ability to put on
system maintenance/usermods/sysmods/PTFs/exits/SVCc or whatever, then you have
the ability to spread infection.  But if your security system is worth its
weight and your auditors are doing their job, it's probably not going to go
unnoticed for too long.  Jim and Pete Lucas put it well:  1) if you're going
to spend millions on the system, it's well worth your while to spend a few
thousand for a security system; and 2) why invest the money in RACF or ACF2
if you're not using it the way it was intended. (This applies to security
breeches as well as viruses).

Jim's description of what happens under MVS is pretty accurate as far as
executables is concerned, and I have some corrections to mine.  Bruce Ide
pointed out that most OSes have a distinction between code and text.  MVS
is part of the rule rather than the exception, as I had thought earlier.
It turns out, that not just most, but all executable code is stored in
pds libraries (at least if you want it to load properly; you can store it
anywhere, but if you want it to load, it has to be in a pds).  As part of
the directory info a pds keeps, it has an executable flag for each member.
This flag gets set to 'yes' when the linker successfully links a program.
The default is off, and if the linker has enough problems with a program,
it will mark it non-executable.  Therefore, all a virus has to do is check
this flag for a particular member and can infect whenever.

What Jim goes on to describe is right on the head as far as what happens
under *normal* circumstances when updating a pds.  It is a similar scenario
to what happens to a pc program under normal circumstances.  On a pc, when
you want to update a program because you added a new procedure, you recompile
the code (perhaps into an OBJ or UNIT or similar zero-start subroutine, or
perhaps into EXE form), and if necessary, relink all the dependent programs
together and the program has been replaced.  But a virus bypasses those normal
means, and *could* do so successfully on a mainframe, although it would be
MUCH more difficult.  On a mainframe, there is a higher possibility that
there are inter-program dependecies that would force relinking, and a virus
could much more easily wipe out a program call using overlay techniques.
The easiest way would be to modify the first instruction to a BR to begining of
viral code, and then as the last to instructions of the virus, execute the
origional first instruction and BR to beginning of code +1, tacking your virus
onto the end of the program.  This doesn't necessarily mean a relink of the
program or the writing to the end of the library and changing the pointer.
You can rewrite the member, if you wish, but if you know the directory
structure, you can make certain modifications without rewriting.  And tacking
onto the end is almost as easy as it is on a PC, because of the nature of
pds libraries.  PCs are hard-sectored, and the entire sector must be read/
written every time, regardless of where the changes were made, so you could
hide viral code in the unused portion of the sector.  Similarly, pds libs are
fixed record length, fixed block size datasets.  It is possible to use that
extra space at the end of the block or record to your advatage (if you were
a virus).

Besides, you don't really have to relink the program anyway, SUPERZAP is
a nice utility that allows you to zap executables without having to go
through the trouble of relinking.  In the case of vendor products, you can't
do that anyway, because the source usually isn't available to you.
Jim is right, with the complexity of what a virus on a mainframe would have
to deal with, and the knowledge required to write one in the first place,
compromising system integrity in *this* way is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  It more
than likely will be noticed quickly, but if there's a lot of system activity,
a new system coming up, etc., it may not be.  It's difficult, but it can be
done.  It all comes down to trusting the people who have the ability to blow
something up to not blow it up and monitoring your system carefully.

Subject: Virus summary list

I just downloaded the "vsum" list by Patricia M. Hoffman.  It is a very good
list, but it contains quite a few inaccuracies and omissions.

Some of the most obvious ones:

Amstrad: It is a variant of the older Pixel virus, which was written by a
hacker in Greece. Descriptions of all the Bulgarian variants are missing.

Dark Avenger: Description of the 2000 byte variant is missing.

Ghost Boot: it is NOT a virus, as it does not replicate by itself.  Also,
it was not discovered at the University of Iceland.

Halloechen: Samples are available.

Joker:  I am not yet convinced it is a virus, as I have been unable to make it
infect anything at all.

Oropax: is not "usually 2773" byte long.  Samples are available, both from
Germany and Poland.

Pentagon: It does not work, does not replicate, does not infect anything,
although is seems to have been intended to be a virus.

Saratoga: Saratoga does not bypass INT 21, like Icelandic-II does.

Suriv 3.00:  It is not a variant of Jerusalem - Jerusalem was probably derived
from this virus.

Syslock:  There seem to be two variants of Macho, one very similar to Syslock,
but the other one rather different.

Vacsina, Yankee Doodle: Basically all the interesting information on this
family of 50 viruses is missing.

The viruses missing from the list are most of the Bulgarian viruses, some
very recent ones and Virus-B (from InterPath):

	E.D.V.
 	Korea (Lbc)
	8-tunes
	Advent
        Amoeba
	Anarkia
	Dark avenger-B
        Durban
        Eddie II
        Kennedy
        Number of the Beast
        Old Yankee
        Pretoria
        PrintScreen
        Prudents
        PSQR
        Tenbyte
        Virdem
        Virus-B
        VP
        XA1

Finally - the information about F-PROT is not up to date. It is also able to
detect and remove Devil's Dance, Halloechen and 1260, in addition to the
"missing" viruses listed above.

Subject: VSHIELD Bug Fix (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
===========================================================

	Many thanks to Santo Nucifora from Seneca College for his
posting yesterday regarding his testing of VSHIELD.  He noted that
VSHIELD did not detect the Ping Pong virus in an already infected
system.  We ran parallel tests and, sure enough, VSHIELD
successfully prevents infection from Ping Pong, but it does not
detect it if it is installed on an already infected system.  In
fact, it fails to detect most of the boot sector viruses if
installed on an already infected system.
	This is a serious bug and has been fixed .  Version 62B (we
don't want to designate it 63, else it will get out of synch with
SCAN and related programs) is out and successfully detects already
infected systems with the single exception of the Brain virus.  It
will, however, PREVENT an infection from the Brain virus.
	Major new product releases frequently have a few quirks at
first.  This one was caused by a last minute change which everyone
agreed could have no material impact on the logic of the program.
Wrong again.  We performed quick last minute tests to ensure that
it still stopped all of the known viruses, and neglected to re-test
in infected environments.  We regret that this bug was as serious
as it is.
	I apologize sincerely for any confusion or misunderstanding
caused by our error.

Subject: pc - archimedes virus?

  I have an Archimedes ( no harddisk )  which runs a PC emulator. On April 1st
the symptoms of a virus started. Every eighth disk access ( different disks),
the machine crashes, which can only be resolved by a control break reset.

 Now I know next to nothing about virii, but I've talked to several people
'in the know'. They agreed it sounded like a virus but my MS-DOS disks have
 been checked and seem to be ok, however, nobody seems to know anything about
 the Archimedes side of things.

 The problem doesnt occur while the emulator is running - only in the Arc
 desktop environment. As far as I know there are no lengthening of files.

 For all I know it may just be a computer fault. If anyone can help or send
me information about symptoms, tell-tale signs and actions to take, about
the virii on the Archimedes I'd like to hear from you.

Thanks.
