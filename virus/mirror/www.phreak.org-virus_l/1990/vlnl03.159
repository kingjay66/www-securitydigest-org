Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: Emulation?

	Just a small area for discussion, I don't know if it has been
discussed before, but what are the possibilities of a virus being
emulated? For example, if I have an IBM emulator on a Macintosh, could
the emulator on the Mac generate code for the equivalent interrupts?
I know this would be more cumbersome than the IBM equivalent, but still
is it possible?

  The "known virus-busters" notion has always been somewhat of a pet
peeve of mine.  I'm at a location that has a steady flow of Macintosh
viruses (read: frequent reinfection) but has been blissfully free of
the PC variety - possibly due to our network and lab strategy.  I'm
interested in the development of virus removal programs (PC), but I'm
not willing to undergo the sort of hassle that seems to follow a
request for samples (note: I haven't tried to get samples, I'm just
judging by what I've read here, particularly statements that requests
for virus samples won't be considered or forwarded).
  It is my belief that a person or organization should be able to
obtain "live" samples, detection, and removal information for research
- - provided that person can be reasonably assumed to be responsible, ie
a programmer or network administrator at a site.  It's not that I
believe accountability = 100% reliability, rather, that it's more
likely that someone with a reputation on the line would not carelessly
redistribute viruses.
  It is also my belief that being a "recognized virus buster" doesn't
really equate to the ultimate in security.  In this vein, I present
the following rehash (slightly edited for brevity):

  I'd personally like to see a standard criteria applied to the
distribution of viruses and related information, rather than presuming
that the current crew are the only ones with any legitimate interest
in the field.  It also seems as though marginal changes in code to
identify the source of an "escaped" virus could help keep people on
their toes.

Must disagree on this one. I "own" my PC. As on mainframes, most of
the time my processes are denied access to "privileges" - this does
not mean that privilege is not available when requested, just that 99%
of the time it is unnecessary, and, for many years I have had the
habit of only taking on those privileges I need - that way programs
requireing privileges not available to most users are identified
early.

Point is that just because you choose to protect the O/S from your
"accidents", this does not mean that you are permanently locked out,
nor that a virus is either. Already, in some cases, booting from a
protected floppy is the only recourse for recovery (though EVERY virus
I have seen so far, including 4096 and Joshi, are easily detectable in
memory.

I have found that a small dose of education plus an easy, effective
means of screening software does wonders. For too many years we just
pointed people at a PC and expected them to use it like a typewriter
or calculator. If users of systems in our care do not understand
viruses or are apathetic about precautions, that is our fault, not
theirs.

This is pure B.S. and sounds like a politician. I know, am going out
on a limb again since have not seen the "mother
fish"/"whale"/"Gordius" as yet but am relying on the fact that by
definition a virus must change things and ANY change is detectable. If
the change is hidden then the mechanism used to hide the change is
detectable, etc. 1st, any virus is detectable if not resident since it
cannot hide itself from observation. If it is resident, then it must
be resident somewhere. This is not to say that there are not some very
tricky possibilities for residency, but even these are detectable.

In the last few months my old three-byte test has grown to six-bytes
(Joshi is easier to find when resident than when dormant unless you
look specifically for the 1fh signature and I do not like signature
tests - not that they are not effective, but that they require
constant updates)

Of course, my job is made much easier in that I do not have to
identify infections, John McAfee and Morton and Frisk do an excellent
job, all I need to know is that SOMETHING has happened & then reel out
the arsenal. Similarly, this should be the attitude of users / generic
detection software: determine that something has happened & call for
help. This can be done with virtually no impact. To provide this
environment is our responsibility. <end_of_soap_box>

I don't think a "polite" AVV would spread.  Noone would say "yes".  A
"considerate" AVV would kill itself if it detected any form of anti-viral
software known to be able to detect the virus(es) that the AVV is hunting.

I think Howard's idea of food points is clever and would not significantly
reduce the AVV's effectiveness.

another note:  Is it true that the destructive viruses are less
contagious because they are more likely to be noticed?

We have noticed a "stoned virus" infection on a hard disk in our lab.
Unfortunately i couldn't find enough information on this kind of virus
in past issues.  Would anyone in the list please send me answers to
the following questions ?
    - How does the virus replicate?
    - What kind of damage does it cause on the hard disk ?
    - How can one get rid of it ?
Thanks in advance.

I know of a case where the speed virus propagation was measured. The
virus we now call 'The Internet Worm' and the researcher was Robert T.
Morris [Jr.].  (Yeah, I know, it was a worm and not a virus). Whether
you like it or not, the best way to measure propagation is by letting
out a relatively harmless 'test virus'

About a year and a half ago, one of the guys at work had been playing
Lesiure Suit Larry a lot.  One day, he mistyped the date, to somthing
like the next year, and up popped a colored picture of a computer with
a jagged break down the middle.  We never did find what it was, but
did suspect a virus.  We have not been able to find it since.  Has
anyone ever seen this before?

Secondarily, it seems to me that there is a class of viruses that we
fortunatly have not seen yet.  Application specific viruses.  Consider
a virus written by someone who is POed at LOTUS for thier recent court
victory (really a sad chapter in computer history).  This virus would
infect and spread, but only corrupt a program that had a lotus
copyright on it.  I seem to remember a note about a bulgarian virus
that looked for an anti viral product and trashed it.  Has anyone
encountered a virus that exhibits the above behaviors?

Subject: Mac misbehavior (Mac)

Recently a Mac which I am basically responsible for the general health of (it
is the office computer in the fine arts department at my high school) has come
down with some strange symptoms.
  A week or so ago I installed some new stuff, mostly PD and shareware picked
up from a friend. All of these were things he had used on his system for the
last several months without any problem.
  Well, problems cropped up immediately. Soundmaster installed and ran
perfectly - except it adamantly refused to play anything on startup. All the
other options worked fine.
  The more puzzling thing is that Disinfectant, when run, produced a bomb box.
The error ID was consistently 03, which, according to the table of system
errors I have, is a bad instruction. This happened consistently, regardless of
removing INITs and desk accessories and everything else I could think of.
  At first I thought it was probably an incompatibility with the System, which
was only version 6.0; I said I'd see if I could get hold of an update, and
left it at that.
  But yesterday, Microsoft Works data files started refusing to automatically
load Works when opened from the Finder, much to the confusion of the music
teachers. It turned out that Works itself ran fine and the documents could be
loaded fine from within it (fortunately) - but something was rather amiss.
  I ran Disinfectant from the floppy disk I'd copied it from my friend on;
somewhat to my surprise, it ran properly. A scan of the hard disk uncovered no
viruses, but did determine that the hard disk copy of Disinfectant had a
damaged resource fork. All very well: throw out that copy and make a fresh one
from the floppy. Done. Guess what: the problem recurred - without, indeed,
running anything else in the meantime.
  Today I further discovered that when I duplicated Disinfectant on a floppy,
renamed it "fubar", and copied both to the hard disk, one worked and the other
didn't... and that Apple's disk-doctor program did NOT work from the original
system-utilities disk (write-protected, of course) though it DID when copied
to the hard disk. (It generated a bomb box with an error 02 - illegal
address.)

  The system in question is a rather vanilla Mac SE - 20 meg HD, 720K floppy,
1 meg memory, no particular expansions. System version 6.0.
The version of Disinfectant I have is 1.7; I know that's not the highest, but
the computer isn't connected to anything and getting stuff is extremely
difficult. :(

  My apologies for the excessive length, but since I really don't know a thing
about the inner workings of Macs I thought I'd better add everything in case
someone who does know can help.

  The obvious question, of course: does this look like any particular known
virus? It's not impossible that the whole thing is a symptom of a decaying
hard drive, or something, after all...
  Disinfectant didn't detect anything, and I don't think Gatekeeper has; but
whatever it is, if it is a virus, could be able to go around them. I tried to
borrow a copy of SAM-Intercept from someone to check further, but it decided I
was violating its copyright and wouldn't let me.

  Thanks...

The problem with "food points", and other self-limiting strategies in
general, is that from an evolutionary perspective these limitations
are *flaws*, and the evolutionary pressure will be to remove these.

For an example: suppose you have a virus with a mutation that prevents
it from losing food points when it runs or reproduces.  This mutant
will constantly accumulate food points and replicate faster and faster
until it eventually becomes a dominant subspecies of this virus.

Of course, you could introduce AAVVs to hunt down and kill the mutant
strain of AVV, but if you try to limit the reproduction of the AAVVs
then they will be under the same evolutionary pressure to eliminate
those limitations.

Another option might be a "genetic purity" behavior for the AVVs where
they scan any other AVVs of the same species they encounter and kill
them if the others' code differs from its own.  But in the long run,
the mutant AVVs will have the upper hand since they can reproduce
faster and exterminate any members of the unmutated strain that they
encounter.

Mike Travers at the MIT Media Lab performed some interesting
experiments with simulated creatures that evolved to take advantage of
bugs in the simulator.  Like the AVVs above, these creatures could
forage for food and reproduce by giving a certain amount of its food
to its offspring.  One species evolved which was able to reproduce at
the clock rate of the simulation -- it did this by giving its
offspring more food than the parent.  The parent dies immediately, but
not before generating a child (who dies on the next clock tick, after
producing another child, and so on).

If AVVs ever become necessary, it will probably be futile to attempt
to hobble them with a software ball-and-chain.  They should probably
be designed as viable (i.e. non-self-destructive / rapidly
reproducing) but benign organisms from the start.  Of course, some
will mutate to become destructive, but at least there won't be any
evolutionary pressure toward destructiveness.  If anything, there will
be a pressure towards benignity, since a harmful virus that mutates
into a nondestructive form will be less likely to be detected and
destroyed.

I don't consider AVVs either necessary or beneficial now, but if the
virus population even expands to the level where the majority of
systems carry some sort of virus, then at least AVVs could increase
the probability of having a benign population on your system.

Subject: New viruses? (MAC)

I've been told about a recent CNN report, supposedly dealing with 2
new Macintosh viruses. The person who told me about this could not
remember the names of either, but said that one of them had "DEF" as
part of its name. He said it was *not* MDEF or WDEF. He could not
remember if it was CDEF, but said he did *not* think it was. He said
that the report indicated that there was no "cure" for one of the
viruses, and that Symantec (he mentioned this company by name) was
"feverishly" working on countermeasures to combat that virus. Has
anyone on VIRUS-L heard this CNN report? Can you fill in the blanks?
I wonder if this person misunderstood, and CNN was actually referring
to the "Whale" virus (DOS)?

Also, I've recently heard about a variant of nVIR called "prod". Does
anyone have information about this one? Will the current set of
anti-viral tools handle it, since it's supposed to be just another
clone? Will it even be tracked separately?

Thanks for whatever insight can be added.

Hi,

I have been hearing strange rumors recently, and wanted to see if they
were real.  Has anyone heard of a Macintosh virus that attacks
LaserWriters??  I have heard that one exists which causes damage to
the logic board.  I doubt the truth of this, but I don't know for
sure.  Has anyone seen this virus?  Has anyone else heard this rumor?
Am I a babling on aimlessly??

I would appreciate any replies, as I know of a pair (or possibly 3)
LaserWriters which have all developed a problem recently.  This may
just be a false alarm, but I really don't know!

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Mac Anomolies with AppleShare & Ethernet (Mac)

    Food for thought.  I would LOVE to find out if anyone else has
come across this problem.  Occasionally, (3 times in the past 5
months) I have noticed that AppleShare will not load (hang in fact)
when I boot my machine.  Often, about 10 other people have this
problem.  Fixing it is a pain.  If I disable AppleShare with init 2.0,
the machine boots and loads in its 40 billion inits and everything
else works well, inculding QuickMail.  Therefore, I assume that it is
an AppleShare problem, not a network/ethertalk one.  So I reinstall
AppleShare 2.0.1.  Same problem, AppleShare hangs on startup.  So, I
reinstall the network software (ethertalk 2.0.1 and 1.2 - we only use
1.2) by installing 2.0.1 and dragging the previous version 1.2 into
the system folder.  Restart.  SAME PROBLEM!!  So, I remove AppleSare,
AppleShare Prep and Network.  In the following order, I install
AppleShare from the AppleShare workstation Install disk (running 6.0.5
so it will boot our machines) - Ethertalk 2.0.1 from the ethernet
installation disk (I made a 6.0.5 installer from the standard
installation disk) - then drag the pervious version (1.2) from the
same disk into the system.  Reboot.  Use Init 2.0 to make sure
AppleShare is not disabled.  Go to network from the control panel and
select the version of ethertalk we currently use and VIOLA! IT WORKS!
But why?  I have NO clue.  This is reproducable, in fact I am going to
reproduce it at least 4 more times today to get the rest of our
machines up again.  The funny thing is that only about 10 of our 100+
machines got nuked.  They were mac II's, cx's, ci's Fx's and one Se.
My hypothesis is that someone is sending out packets to our Fastpath
and they are hitting other macs running AppleShare.  One of our
employees got hit around 3pm on tuesday, I got hit between 6 and 7pm
tuesday.  Is this rouge ethernet board behavior or am I just doomed to
suffer working on Macs in a predominantly IBM company?  We may never
know.

Any Ideas/insights are welcome, but I would prefer a solution.B-]
