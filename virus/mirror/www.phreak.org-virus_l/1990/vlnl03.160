VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

    More News from the front.  After going through that lengthy
procedure to reinstall AppleShare and Network, I went for a looong
lunch.  Yesterday, I rebooted 2 machines that I knew were
infected/affected and they were hanging, waiting, arter AppleShare
loaded in.  Presumabely trying to find our servers.  Wellll, after
lunch I came back and those machines that had been waiting for 18
hours to startup, finally found the connections to the servers and are
working?!?!  I am not amused.  Well, at least I don't have to fix them
as well.  Honestly, am I the only one to notice this?

Does anyone know of any virus that wipes out files indiscriminately as
they are accessed?  I am using a PS2/30 with a Toshiba TMX3100A1
CD-ROM drive that is causing us much grief.  We thought we had it
fixed when all the files in the ISI CD-ROM software directory were
wiped out on Friday.  They are ir- retrievable using PC-TOOLS, so we
assume they are no longer on the file allocation table.  We now think
that the problem is either a virus or a major software or hardware
problem.  If anyone has experienced anything like this, please let me
know.  We have tried several virus diagnostics, but could not find a
match, so it's probably a new one.

Subject: Frodo's Day (PC)

As has previously been reported, the 'Frodo' (alias 4096, 4K, IDF)
virus will activate on September 22nd.

The virus will then overwrite the boot sector code with a short
program, whose function is to display the text 'FRODO LIVES' in large
letters in the middle of the screen.  It will then place a moving
border around the text and disable the keyboard - making Ctrl-Alt-Del
ineffective.

However - all the copies I have seen of this virus are defective - it
seems that the virus may even (by mistake) have garbled itself.  The
reason for this is not known, however.

The code which was garbled is the boot-writing part mentioned above.
Programs infected with the virus will therefore probably not work as
intended, but may instead hang the machine if they are run on Sept 22.

There is no great cause for alarm - the virus is fairly harmless, at
least compared to some of the real 'nasties' - but it has spread
rapidly recently....

If anyone discovers an uncorrupted copy of the virus, which activates
as described above, I would appreciate a report.

Subject: Viruses in Sound Effects (Mac)

Another correspondent made the following comments in response to my
description of a virus in a sound effect file.

> Um, I hate to dispute your point that *everything* should be checked,
> but soundfiles (be they "snd " resources or FSSD/SFX! files from

1.  On checking with the coworker and his manager, it seems that the
sound file was really a modified "Sound" cdev Control Panel File,
which does contain executable code.  Of course, anyone should have
known that a cdev is executable.

2.  There were other files on the disk, and they may have included a
desk accessory or sound editor that may have also had nVIR.

3.  The real problem is of course that he had Virex installed and
didn't use it.

4.  It is true that nVIR only infects executable code.  But other
Macintosh viruses affect other types of resources.  Therefore:
Check everything.

5.  Free software is worth LESS than you paid for it if it has
viruses.

                         paid me to say this.

>what are the possibilities of a virus being emulated

Any good IBM emulator ought to be able to support a virus - after all,
the objective is create an enviroment that, from the program's point
of view, is identical to an IBM PC.  In fact, an emulator can provide
an excellent virus testbed.  I have an Acorn Archimedes, which has a
proprietory CPU and operating system.  The IBM emulator can support a
hard disc which is in actuality a large file within the Acorn filing
system.  It is therefore possible to examine the disc 'at arms length'
with absolutely no chance of virus inteference or replication.

In practice, though, writing a 100% compatible emulator is no easier
than building a 100% compatible PC - for example, the AIDS trojan that
my hard disc was actually a floppy, and refused to install itself.
The bottom line, though, is that if your emulator is capable of
running MSDOS, it is almost certainly capable of supporting a virus.

Subject: Virus book/article

   My apologies if this question was asked beforehand.

   I am interested in getting some pointers to reading material (could
be either a book or an article) on how one would normally deal with a
newly encountered virus. - I'm mainly interested in learning a
standard method to disinfect a diskette/hard-disk from the new virus.
Any ideas?

   Could you please email me directly, since I'm not a regular reader of
this group?  If there's enough interest I'll send a summary.

   Thanks

[description of symptoms deleted]
System 6.0 is full of bugs!  Do not use it!  (I think some of the bugs can
even damage files.)

There was a whole lot of commotion when 6.0 came out because it had so many
problems.

You should use System 6.0.2 or higher.

Well, we have seen a few - here is a partial list.

Macho/Syslock - looks for "Microsoft" and changes it to "Macrosoft"/"Machosoft"
The (reported only) "SYS" variant of "Den Zuk".
Flip - seems to target an unknown program, perhaps an anti-virus progra,
dBase - corrupts dBase files.
There have been unconfirmed reports of two viruses - "Novell" and "123",
targeted against those products.

There may be a few more - I just don't remember them right now...
