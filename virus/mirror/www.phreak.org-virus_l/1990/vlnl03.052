VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Virus catalog updated

I have just received and forwarded to the IBMPC anti-viral archive sites
an update to Dr. Brunnstein's virus catalog.  This gives a detailed
description of a number of viruses.  This release is an addendum to
previous releases; it does NOT replace them.

Subject: Copyright on viruses?

Copyright of virus code - remember that the copyright laws in many
countries are largely non-existent. Do not assume that copyright law
as operated in the USA/Europe/anywhere else actually applies to the
country where the virus is written/copied/assembled/disassembled. How
can you even think of trying to enforce copyright? If i disassemble
the virus with my disassembler, and someone else uses the same
disassembler on the same virus, so what?  You get the same disassembly
- - thats what!
The whole question of copyrighting viruses is an irrelevant diversion to
the task of identifying the sources and writing disinfectors.

          I am in the process of composing a paper for my Operating Systems
class, on the topic of worms, viruses, and trojan horses on distributed
systems.  Can anyone suggest (or better yet send) a good article/book
that they have read to fill me in on the basics.

> Re danger of publishing signature strings.

How about publishing the signatures that have processed by a one way
algorithm such as Xerox's SNEFRU?  Knowing the processed signature
would let you detect the original sequence without knowing exactly
which bytes were used to form the original sequence.

Possible?

Subject: Printer Related Virus? (Mac)

I have now seen at least 3 notices regarding what people originally
thought was WDEF. ALL noted problems while printing. ALL noted that
the virus was NOT detected by virus-detecting programs that are fully
capable of detecting WDEF. I am left with one real thought: a new
virus?

I know nothing about Macintoshes. Our local power-users are infinitely
more familiar than I. However, it occurs to me that a resourceful
person could possibly create a PDEF virus (Assuming there is a PDEF to
infect.)  Could a TECHNICALLY-ORIENTED PROGRAMMER please check for me
to see if PDEF exists? If so, I suggest the probability that someone
has converted the WDEF idea into a PDEF.

Either way, could the people who reported the virus infections PLEASE
call one of the authors of the utilities they checked their computers
with? They can't write a checker for a virus they don't have.
(Then again, it's possible that the posters just didn't use the virus-
checkers correctly.)

Subject: Memory scans vs. file scans

Since my earlier posting to this list (about a problem with SCAN
reporting a virus in the memory, and not in the file) a number of
things happened.  First, we did some hacking of cleaned programs, and
found out that the problem was indeed in cluster boundary when DOS
writes a file to disk, which was subsequently confirmed by John
McAfee, and when the file is scanned, SCAN can't find anything in the
file. Now, I have a further question for the list. Correct me if I am
wrong, but I belive that it shouldn't be to hard to calculate the
cluster boundary, and write zeroes to the end of the last cluster
which is occupied by the file, or, alternatively, write zeroes over
the full length of the file, and then update the directory entry. That
I belive, should cure such problems and confusion.

Subject: Unknown virus ??? (PC)

I may have a problem with a virus but can't identify it. The affected
file is a compression utility - when I run it the computer just hangs
and beeps at me, when I run the file after loading SCANRES the
computer just hangs. I have another copy, both are the same size but
DOS COMP gives 10+ differences. I've scanned the memory and the file
with SCAN 3.0V58 and F-SYSCHK 1.7 but neither shows anything.  Does
this sound like a virus, the file has been moved to a floppy and
overwritten on the hard disk.  It's probably not a virus but the fact
that the sizes are the same has made me abit vary.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Scanning MAC diskettes on a PC

After reading how the WDEF virus on the MAC propagates when an
infected disk is inserted in the MAC, I would like to suggest the
approach of using a PC with a 3 1/2 drive to scan the MAC diskettes
and check for viruses. Assuming the PC hardware can read everything
the MAC can, this would be safer, IMHO, than using a MAC for this
task, for the chance of a virus being able to infect both a MAC and a
PC seem remote.

Using the MAC to scan DOS diskettes may also be possible, but
something would have to be done to prevent the MAC from assuming the
disk is legitimate when inserted.

This approach would also avoid the casual approach taken by some lab
supervisors, who simply put scan/disinfection tools on one of the lab
machines, without making sure

1) The machine is booted from a "clean" operating system
2) The user is aware of how to use the tools properly.

With this approach, virus victims would have to go to a special
station to be disinfected.

          All the common virus problems can be cured by the public
domain program cleanp written by John McAfee.  It can cure up to
about 65 or so known viruses.  The latest version is 58, I think,
which can be reached from SIMTEL via ftp.  Just "ftp 26.2.0.74" and
download "cleanp57.zip" for the clean program and also "scanv58.zip"
for the virus scanner.  If you don't have pkzip to uncompress these
archives then you need to download "pkz102.exe" also.  You will need
to scan the disks to know what virus to disinfect.  I have removed the
"Stoned", "Ping-Pong" and "Jerusalem" viruses from various computers
at work and in the lab.

          The "stoned" virus is really stupid because it infects the
boot sector of all disks, even non-bootable disks which cannot spread
the virus and end up as carries.  Luckily it doesn't infect files.

          This program has helped many people with the problem of
computer viruses.  I don't know what else we can do with these stupid
virus programs besides delete them when we're infected.  It will be a
good idea to use McAfee's scan program on all disks you come in
contact with before using them.

Never trust a strange disk !

If there are any more problems or questions - just send then to out
the net ...  Viruses are a common problem and we all need to know how
to deal with them.  Even John McAfee, himself is listening.

          I told you how to clean a disk, but I didn't really answer
your question.  After you get the clean program, you can run it in a
simple batch file as follows:

- -------------------------- cut here ----------------------------------------

@echo off
:retry
echo Insert disk to clean in drive A:
echo (Press any key to continue or Ctrl-C to quit)
pause > nul
clean a: [stoned]
goto retry

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have each user run this with all their disks.

I hope this solves your virus problem !

Subject: New Trojan Warning! (Mac)

A new Trojan horse on the Macintosh has been discovered. This one
poses as a program designed to give out Virus information. The copy I
saw was called 'Virus Info'. It starts by displaying a terse warning
about being more careful about what you run on your Macintosh. Then it
does the following damage. It first attempts to delete the Finder on
the current system disk. If the delete succeeds, the Trojan continues
by attempting to zero the first 50 sectors of the system disk (thus
destroying the volume info, bitmap, directory, etc.).

If the Finder delete fails (this will fail if you are running
MultiFinder), the Trojan puts up an error alert and exits. SO, the
Trojan seems to do NO damage if you are using MultiFinder (I don't
guarantee this, but it never seemed to damage anything when I was
using MultiFinder).

I did not do a complete examination of the program, so it's possible
the Trojan is also doing something else which I didn't notice. I also
did not check to see whether the Trojan attempted to damage volumes
other than the current system volume.

For SAM users: If you are using SAM in advanced mode, then you will be
alerted to this Trojan's attempts to overwrite the volume info and
directories. Denying these attempts prevents damage to the volume and
directory info. (Note: If you have a very small system disk, such as a
floppy, then it is possible that the desktop file or some other file
might be damaged by this Trojan.)

The Brain virus was written by Mohammed Farooq Alvi in Lahore
(Pakistan) and was used initially to protect their own software from
being pirated.  The Alvi brothers sold "bad" copies of their programs
to Americans who then had to pay an additional amount of money to get
the program they bought to work. That's probably why there was a
copyright notice included in the header.

I hate to disapoint you, but there are literally dozens of variations
of the Cascade/1704 virus. Most of the reside mainly in Vienna, and
most seem to have stayed there. This goes also for the Vienna virus.
Although it may be useful to have looked at all of them, at the
moment I have enough to do.

Perhaps one should say that Vienna can be dangerous to your computer's
health, but soon we can say that of nearly everywhere, so whats the
point.

Now that would indeed be funny. As I am sure some virus programmers
read virus-l, perhaps we'll see one soon.

But should they? Say a new variant of 1704 comes along where the
original code is not saved at the same location, what then?
