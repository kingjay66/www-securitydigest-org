VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday, 14 Feb 1990    Volume 3 : Issue 41

Today's Topics:

Introduction to the VIRUS-L Index
VIRUS-L Index IBM PC Topics
VIRUS-L Index Macintosh Topics
VIRUS-L Index Miscellaneous Topics

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Introduction to the VIRUS-L Index

This posting is the introduction to the VIRUS-L Index.  Hopefully
these indexes will be helpful to all.  I've only been able to index
the digests from January 1, 1990 as of yet, and still I am about a
week or two behind.  Should I ever catch up, I will begin to index
back-digests.

I plan to send out about one of these every month or so, and I
would guess that after 3 or so months I will have to start anew, for
the index will get too lengthy.  Any suggestions in that area will be
greatly appreciated.

The index's topics are my own personal views on the content of each
article; I have tried to sum up the contents of each in one line.  In
the cases that either the topic or the general heading does not point
to a specific article's subject line from the digest, I have included
the subject line in square brackets.

[Ed. Thanks for providing this great service, Karyn!  I hope that the
index helps everyone out in going through back issues.  I'll maintain
a copy of the index for anonymous FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu, in
pub/virus-l/archives.  Feedback on format etc. is appreciated and can
be sent to Karyn and/or to myself.]

The following is an index of the VIRUS-L Digest involving IBM PC topics
of 1990 (Volume 3).  They are referenced by Digest number.  I have
included a short description of what the article is about, and in the
cases that the description does not match the article's subject line,
I have placed the subject line in square brackets.

  I thought shrink wrapped s/w was safe?!                              9
  3 steps to safe s/w                                                 10
  Retailers can re-shrinkwrap s/w                                     10
  Retailers perhaps use tamper-resistant packaging like Tylenol?      11
  Get in habit of scanning everything - stores re-wrap and
         commercial distributers sometimes have viruses               11
  Stores don't do virus checks on returned S/W (case history)         11

  Some vendors do sell s/w on write-protected diskettes               12
  Comment on vendor sell write-prot. s/w [Protecting s/w
                        from contamination]                           12
  In the UK they rarely see shrink-wrap; retailer won't demo          12
  Someone determined can write on a write-protected disk              13
  Most software comes write-enabled                                   13
  Most infections are by the well-intentioned                         14
  You do want to deal with retailers with a return policy             14
  Answer from someone who works in a store [re: some more thoughts
                            on shrink-wrapped software]               14
  Suggest that vendors w/ write prot. disks note that fact on disk    14
  Stores can *simply* do a sector-by-sector, byte-by-byte compare
                     of returned software                             15
  Why not just run a good virus checker?                              15
  If someone really wanted to infect a write-prot. disk, they could   15
  Dispute V3 #15 (*simply*)                                           20
  Trivial to tweak a drive to think a disk is writable - S/W not
                              factory write-protected                 21
  If S/W is returned, store ships disks to vendor, vendor ships
                                     clean disks to store             24
