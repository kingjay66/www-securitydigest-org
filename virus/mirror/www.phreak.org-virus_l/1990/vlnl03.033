VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: WDEF in Toronto (MAC)

Humber College in Toronto has been hit by the WDEF virus.  We first
detected it when machines began crashing (mouse still moved cursor
around the screen, but no other response).   It had managed to infect
the desktop of our server by the time we caught up with it..
We had resident virus protection in place, but it was too old to
snag WDEF.

We brought it under control with Disinfect 1.5 and Eradicat'Em.  We
tried Gatekeeper Aid prior to Eradicate'Em,  but it seemed not to work
on our IIcx's and SE30's.

We've also survived NVIR A and NVIR B.

>From the reports I've read NVIR and WDEF both have no malicious
intent, and that any damage they cause are 'side effects'.  Is this
accurate?

It seems very strange to me that Virus writers would launch
their missiles with no payload...

Subject: GateKeeper Aid on AppleShare Server (Mac)

I installed Gatekeeper Aid on our AppleShare File and Print Server
today.  When I rebooted the server, I got the message "GateKeeper Aid
encountered FCB expansion."  Can someone tell me what this means?
Thanks,

Subject: Idea for WDEF Innoculation (Mac)

Just like everywhere else the WDEF is thriving here at Carnegie-Mellon
Univ.  I recently removed WDEF A & B off of 15 disks of a friend of
mine.  When I commented to somone here about the virus they said there
was nothing they could do to stop it, except remove it once a machine
got infected.

I don't know much about Macs (Being a PC person) but if I understand
correctly every time the disk is inserted the they Virus is sread to
the disk.  Well, why doesn't someone write an innoculation directly
based on the virus itself.  Everytime a disk is inserted in the drive
it would be checked for infection if so it would remove WDEF if not it
would then 'innoculate the disk' with itself.  Eventually, WDEF would
be wiped out the same way it was spread initially.

The only problem with this is that it is a virus also, but with the
proper prompts (allowing the user the choice of being innoculated) I
don't think this would be a problem.  I know I would mind not ever
being infected by a virus that kills other viruses.

In the mean time, about 75% of the time I in a cluster I remove WDEF A
or B from either a hard disk or someone elses floppies.

Later...

Subject: Disinfectant 1.6 (Mac)

     I have recently read something about Disinfectant 1.6 from this
newsgroup.  Its author said that there was no Disinfectant 1.6 and it
maigt cause potential porblems on virus detection.  Someone in our lab
downloaded it and has been using it without any obvious trouble.  I
would appreciate any further comments on this application.  So, again,
is there any upgraded version of Disinfectant after version 1.5 ?  If
not, is there any more information about this "fake" Disinfectant ?

I'm preparing a guide to microcomputer cluster security for the
microcluster managers here at the Univ. of Houston.  What kind of
information would you want to see in such a publication?  What kind of
advice would you offer to someone who's just setting up a cluster?

                          The V-847 Viruses
                          -----------------

        This virus was imported in Bulgaria by foreigner student from
Greece.  He claimed that the virus code was created and published by
the PIXEL magazine.  The virus is supplied as a program in BASIC,
which when run creates a .COM-file which in fact contains the real
virus.

        The virus is extremely stupid. It infects only .COM-files in
the current directory of the current drive. However, it infects *all*
these files at once. The only way to spread the virus is to run an
infected file when one of the directories listed in the PATH variable
is current. Then each time a file from this directory is run, all
files in the current directory will get infected.

        The virus is not memory resident. It becomes active only when
an infected file is run.

        The virus *prepends* itself in front of the infected files.
Their size increases by 847 bytes, most of which contain garbage. Each
infected file contains the generation number of the virus. There are
no effects before the 5th generation. After the 5th generation
however, when you attempt to execute an infected file, you will
succeed with probability of only 1/2 (the lowest bit of the system
timer is used as a random number generator). If the chances are
against you, you will receive the message:

"Program sick error:Call doctor or buy PIXEL for cure description"

and the program will terminate.

        This virus was also hacked a bit.  There are two known
mutations in Bulgaria, however they are not widely spread.  In fact,
they are very rare.  The first is optimized and is 345 bytes long.
The second is even more optimized.  Its length is only 299 bytes.

Subject: WDEF A (Mac)

Today, while I was disinfecting a Macintosh IIx with Disinfectant 1.6
I got a report saying that the desktop was infected at 3:36 p.m. on
2/6.

Now, it just happened that it WAS 3:36 p.m. while I was doing the
disinfecting.

I was using a locked disk which checked clean both with Disinfectant
1.6 and Gatekeeper Aid.

Since the locked disk was clean, it couldn't have infected the HD,
right?  The person involved swears that no other disks had been in his
drives today.

Any ideas?

Subject: "Mosaic" and "FontFinder" Trojan (MAC)

Since my first posting of the two trojans we have detected here at the
University of Alberta, a few things have occurred.  This update is an
attempt to share what we have learned so far:

On a suggestion from Paul Cozza, we determined that both the trojans
we detected are stopped by SAM (Symantec Anti-viral for the Macintosh)
Intercept.  The version tested was quite an old one, but Paul suggests
that all commercially released versions should also stop the trojan
from doing its nastiness.  When we tested SAM, the Mac was invariably
left hung when we "Denied" the permission SAM was requesting, but upon
re-booting, the disks were found to be undamaged.

Several of the anti-viral software developers have contacted us for
further information on this trojan, and we have assisted them wherever
possible.  I would expect versions of many of their packages able to
detect this trojan to start appearing in the near future.

I have received as of this date no reports of infection from any other
sites.  Remember, though the trigger date of 10 Feb 90.  I'll feel a
little more relaxed after that date.

University Computing Systems has prepared a client hand-out that
describes in relatively non-technical terms what both of these trojans
do and what users can do to combat them.  Unfortunately, a lot of the
information is specific to the University of Alberta, but if anyone is
interested, we would be pleased to provide copies of both for your
use, or upload them to VIRUS-L, depending on the demand.  Please
contact me if this would be of assistance to you.

We are continuing our investigations, and will report additional
information as we uncover it.  You will also likely start receiving
informational reports from some of the anti-viral software developers
as to the internal characteristics and structure of these trojans.

The one gratifying aspect of this whole episode is the speed with
which the warning was spread, and the prompt and professional response
we here in the far north received from the anti-virus community as a
whole.  This trojan is dangerous, no question about it.  But not
nearly as dangerous as a full fledged viral version having the same
type of destructive tendancies.  Having a mechanism in place to react
to these attacks is a pretty powerful deterrant force.

In the meantime, please continue to recommend that your Mac users make
regular backups and to practice "safe computing".  I still feel that
user education is one of the most powerful weapons we have to combat
malicious code attacks...

 In Virus-L v3 issue31, ddb@ns.network.com (David Dyer-Bennet) writes
 concerning the 4096 and 1260 viruses:

>John McAfee writes:

What David forgets to mention is that the BBS is the safest source of
virus-free files *as long as the BBS is infected* with these viruses.
Will Sysops now start deliberately infecting their boards with these
viruses so as to assure the users clean files? Is your BBS infected,
Dave? ;-)

One real quick question about this new Mac virus. Do any other
programs detect it (i.e.Virus Rx, Interferon, etc.)? And what versions
if any are you using to detect it?

Thanks,

Subject: More about WDEF

        Can someone tell me is WDEF an illegal string in the resource code?
How about the program called WDEF uploaded in comp.binaries.mac?
        In fact, I've found some WDEF resource code in system version 6.0.3.
        Please tell me more about this resource code.

I have been away from my office and my macintosh network for three
months and when I come back and read my bitnet messages I see there is
a new virus call WDEF.  Can I get some info on this.  What virus
detectors can I use to check out my network?  How can it be
eradicated?  What are its characteristics?  Please send your response
directly to me.

Thanks a bunch.
