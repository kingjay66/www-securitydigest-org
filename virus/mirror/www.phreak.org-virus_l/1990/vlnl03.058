VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Origins of Virus

My OED and Lewis & Short agree that "virus" is a perfectly good Latin
word, meaning "slime", "poison", "venom" &c, and taken over into
English with all these meanings at least as early as 16th
Century.

Perfectly straightforward second declension (like "dominus"), so
genitive and plural are "viri".

I was always under the impression that VALERT-L was primarily
concerned with reports of NEW viruses, not infection tracking.
Perhaps I was mistaken, but I think a third tracking-oriented list
might well be of value to those who are truly interested in tracking.
In that respect people who want/need to know about NEW viruses don't
have to be inundated with reports of infections.

[Ed. VALERT-L is for reporting virus infections.  The distinction
between existing and new viruses was never made.  However, I'm not
fundamentally opposed to creating a list for tracking these things.
If anyone wants to do that, I'd be glad to help them out as much as
possible.]

Subject: Possible virus alert (PC)

        This maybe should have been directed at Virus-Alert, but I am
not too sure:
        I am running an AT clone with a 20M (8425) Miniscribe drive.
I have noticed how the drive power fails (you can hear the drive
whine, power light goes off) every 4-6 minutes if the system clock is
between 4 and 11 pm (at least that's what I tested 'succesfully').  If
the clock is changed, nothing happens.  Boot sector looks OK, booting
from a floppy eliminates the problem.  None of my .exe and .com files
have increased in length, no new files were addes, the only software I
use is either from vendors or Simtel.  I have not imported any new
packages within last 2-3 months.  I have low-level formatted the
drive, and restored all programs from originals (and Simtel). 
System
seems to be OK now.  None of my files were deleted, none of the
programs seems to have been changed (I run a homemade bit comparison
on the last backup and original executables).  The only damage done by
this 'something' was during a save or read operations, where the
computer would respond with 'drive read error' (or 'drive not ready').
        Has anyone else experienced this sort of a problem?  I
strongly suspect a virus, since all evidence seems to point to a
clock-checking code.  On the other hand, I cannot find a trace of the
viral code.  I still have the backups, but I have not been able to
reproduce the error (stores itself on the hard drive only..???).  One
more thing: the number of the bad sectors has increased significantly
in the past 2 months.  Nothing outrages, but significant.  I analysed
the bad sectors, but they are just filled with '@'s (all except the
ones present when I bought the drive).  I would appreciate any advice,
as I expect that a vendor copy of one of my programs may contain the
viral code...

Thanks.

Well, there is no "PDEF", but there are printer drivers (files
containing code) which could become infected.  Also, every Laserwriter
printer has a 68000 and at least a meg of memory, someone could
conceivably infect that.  That's all we need, a PostScript virus...

(Is there a week lag in messages, or has the net been dead since 6 Mar?
Perhaps a virus is chewing them all up...)

"virus" is a normal Latin 2nd declension word, meaning 'poison':-
          Nom    Voc     Acc     Gen     Dat&Abl
    Sing  virus  vire    virum   viri    viro
    Plur  viri   viri    viros   virorum viris
Some case forms coincide with case forms of  the  irregular  noun  "vir"  =
'man',  except  for  the length of the stem vowel. This is academic, as the
plural of 'virus' as used as  English  by  biologists  etc,  is  'viruses'.
'Virus' was first used in English in its  present  meaning  as  'filterable
virus' to mean a supposed (and later proved to exist) infective agent which
couldn't  be  seen  with  the microscopes of the time and would get through
filters that would stop bacteria.

Subject: New Trojan Horse ??? (Mac)

Hi,

Recently I saw a rather disturbing article on what appeared to be a
distructive Macintosh trojan horse in Canada.  The article appeared in
the 19th February issue of the Australian magazine COMPUTING on page
eight.  The article refers to two programs 'Mosaic' and 'Fontfinder'
that were downloaded from a bulliten board in Canada and contained the
trojan horse. The trojan then destroyed the directories of all
unlocked hard and floppy disks that were available.  This included the
disk containing the trojan program.  The affected disks were then
named "Gotcha!".  In the article most of the data was apparently
recovered using a utility program, except for the filenames.  Does
anyone know more on this trojan?  Is it isolated to Canada?  Is this
the only destructive trojan/virus program attacking the mac?

Subject: re: Viruses using Hamming (PC)

Its true, the use of Hamming by viruses isn't very worrying- from
our point of view anyway. It is just a bit of trivia.

Vesselin told me the behind T.P. using Hamming in his viruses, was
to prevent hackers from patching his viruses. Unfortunately it
doesn't help much against those that dissasseble them. Of course,
viruses that do use Hamming have one adventage: they are less likely
to be modified, which make detection a bit easier (less variants).

I don't know if this is even relevant, but I have an IBM PC/AT on my
desk that had similar symptoms.  We fixed it by sending the monitor
out for repairs.  Interestingly, the temporary replacement monitor
showed similar symptoms. (The original would turn green, the
replacement went red).  It took a few tries to get the monitor fixed,
but I've had no problems with it for a couple of months now.

Subject: Re: Unidentified Virus (PC)

If you everything you said is correct I don't think you have any
virus.

If you booted from a CLEAN flopy after power had been OFF, no virus can be
active in the system. Note there are two conditions to above.

I guess if you had some unusual hardware - like battery powered ram, you
might have a virsu - but you would have failed the second condition.

Of course as youy mentioned there is a small amount of battery powered
memeory - for clock and setup parameters. However any virus code inserted
there could only be active if read and executed by a disk based program.
It can't "jump out" on it own - DOS will never read and execute that data.

It is very possible you have a hardware failure - possibly in the disk
controller, - or even in screnn ram, or video cricuits - after
all
what we see on a disk or in ram all depends on the video working
correctly!

An unstaed assumption is that after you boot from clean floppy
you
do NOT execute any program on hard drive or floppy of uncertain
status.

I suggest you FTP to WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL or other
virus archive site and obtain SCANV59. Use it to check your
floppies.

I alos suggest you seek local help from somebody if at all
possible.

Subject: suggestions for anti-virus program wanted (PC)

We need advise please.

We have about 70 DOS machines here, some controlled by
individuals,
some shared by several staff, and some available to the public.

We would like to have a virus detection capability-- a program
which would be housed in our micro support unit and only used
as part of trouble-shooting.

Knowing that detection is a) not 100% and b) after-the-fact,
we will advise our users that their backups are the bottom line
defense against viruses (etc.)

We would like to use SCAN, but the cost for one copy is the same
as the cost for 70 in our institutional setting ($1475).

Questions: 1. is the above a reasonable approach
           2. what software would VIRUS-L readers suggest
