VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

That a lie happens to result in some behavior that you favor, does not
make it any less a lie.  While it may be true that the publicity did
result in a temporary increase in backup behavior, the benefit of such
behavior may not be in proportion to the damage to public trust.

It seems that some nodes are refusing parts of the virus removal
package because of file size constraints (100K max). We are looking
into the problem. Anyone currently signed up for the package will
receive the rest of the files as soon as we have determioned the best
way to redistribute them. Thanks for your patience.

Subject: Implied Loader Viruses (Mac)

Any resource which appears to be of an executable type which is found
in a "non-application" file will be flagged as an "implied loader".
You may have an invisible file called "PIC". Try looking at your disk
with ResEdit or DiskTop.

Subject: F-PROT anti-virus program (PC)

As some of you already know, I have been working on an anti-virus
package the last five months or so.  The English version of this
package, F-PROT, is now (finally) ready for distribution. It can
handle the following PC viruses:

    Agiplan, Alabama, Alameda (Yale), Amstrad, April 1., Brain, Cascade,
    Dark Avenger, DataCrime, DataCrime II, dBase, December 24th, Den Zuk/Ohio,
    Disk Killer (Ogre), Do-Nothing, 405, 4096, Fumble, Fu Manchu, Ghost,
    Icelandic/Icelandic II/Saratoga, Jerusalem/New Jerusalem/Sunday,
    Lehigh, MIX1, New-Zealand (Stoned), Oropax, Perfume, Ping-Pong/Typo,
    South African "Friday 13.", Sylvia, SysLock/Macho, Swap (Fallboot),
    Traceback/2930, Vacsina, Vcomm, Vienna/Lisbon, Virus-90, W13, Yankee
    Doodle and Zero Bug (Palette)

Included in the package are programs for...

   ... scanning diskettes or files for infection (similar to SCAN and
       VIRSCAN)

   ... removing any viruses found without destroying the original programs
       (a complete set of disinfection tools)

   ... preventing infected programs from being executed (similar to SCANRES)

   ... adding "self-testing" to other programs

   ... providing protection against Trojans

and much, much more...

The programs included are even able to prevent the use of Dr Solomon's
"fourth method".

When new viruses appear, only a single tine, containing an encrypted
signature string has to be added to one of the text files.

The package will be distributed as shareware, (suggested contribution
$15 US).

The .ARC file is rather large (237K), but I will arrange for it to be
uploaded to SIMTEL and the various anti-virus archives. I intended to
have the program distributed on comp.sys.ibm.pc, but the resignation
of the moderator there will probably delay that.

I will also E-mail copies to those I have already promised a copy, but
I simply cannot send copies to everyone interested.  However, if you
are willing to upload the package to a BBS or make it available to a
number of other people, let me know and I'll E-mail you a copy.

I will send the package as a XXencoded PKarc file. If you do not have
xxdecode, I can include the source to it (in C).

Jeff_Spitulnik@um.cc.umich.edu tells us of inaction at his institution
upon discovery of a widespread WDEF infestation, and asks:

>  What should be done to rid UM of the WDEF virus or of any virus for
>that matter?  How does the bureaucracy at your institution handle it?
>I question the ethicality of a laissez-faire attitude on viruses at
>any institution.

While I am unfamiliar with the bureaucracy at U. Mich., it certainly
appears to me that Jeff has made a reasonable, good-faith effort to
gain attention through the usual channels, and has been stone-walled.
Rather than speculating as to why, the first priority should be to
protect users from further damage.  You need a campaign of public
education, and you need it yesterday.

I would suggest starting with the student consultants you mentioned in
as online_help receivers.  Give them the tools to detect, remove, and
prevent WDEF (Disinfectant 1.5 with either GateKeeper Aid 1.0.1 or
Eradicat'Em 1.0) and have them put the word out.  If there is another
staffer who is responsible for the students, it may be advisable to go
through him first.  Logon messages, signs in public Mac labs, and
newsletter articles are other possible channels.  Be sure to emphasize
that there's no immediate cause for panic, only prudence.

As for the ethical question ... In my personal opinion, KNOWINGLY
allowing unsuspecting users to contract infections is EXTREMELY
irresponsible.  The question is, is the threat really "known" to the
bureaucracy, or is this a case of "not my department?"  If you have a
co-ordinator of micro labs (or some such position), I might suggest a
review of anti-viral procedures ...

Interesting...where I work (NOT York U, by the way), we had just the
opposite happen.  Since there was no apparent danger from the virus,
there's obviously no need for backups.  This belief is somehow
supported by the fact that all 300+ computers in our building and
remote offices survived the scare. (I won't mention the belief by some
that the virus affected IBM labelled computers ONLY).

And no amount of pleas or lecturing will get them to change.  The only
thing that seems to have an affect is when somebody drops a PC and
trashes a hard disk in the process (and believe me, it's happened more
than once).

In reply to Andreas Pikoulas; Virus-l vol3 no.6:

I have recently downloaded a program that heals/removes this virus.
It is available from:
                      WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
           directory: PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>
                file: M-JRUSLM.ARC

Use anonymous FTP to gain access to the server.

Have considered RWatcher?  It is configurable.  It can be found with
all the other virus stuff at your friendly neighbourhood ftp outlet
that stocks mac stuff, or just go straight to SUMEX and dont pass go
:)

One annoying thing you can do is to spew out paper from the remote fax.
The protocol allows the paper length to be anything up to (i think) 65K
lines or so, so you could spew out 25' of paper at a time, finishing
the receiver's roll of paper and so rendering it useless.  Note that
it doesn't take much time to transmit this image, if it is toally
white or black.
