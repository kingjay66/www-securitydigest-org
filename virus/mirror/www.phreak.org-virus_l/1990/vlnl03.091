VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: Greek "Pixel" virus (PC)

I saw in a previous digest that people referred to a virus they called
"the PIXEL virus". I don't know whether you all have information about
this, but since I *used to* write for "PIXEL" magazine, I personally
know the guy who wrote it and can therefore forward all the
information needed to eradicate and completely destroy the "PIXEL"
"Greek"(sic) virus.  The author of the virus, Nick Nassufis, can be
reached if you send mail to:

Nick Nassufis
"Pixel" magazine
Compupress publications
44 Syngrou ave.
Athens Greece (sorry, don't remember the zip code)

And to set things straight, Nick published the virus for the same
reason I will (if I finally do it) publish source code examples. To
educate people on how to DESTROY them. Now, this had a side-effect,
which I understand, is troublesome.  But education is power... To
leave people ignorant is I think, a crime!  Oh, also: Nick published
the source code of the vaccine (antivirus) in the next issue...

You can get the magazine (which is unfortunately in greek :-) ) if you
send a request to the address above. I can also send the source code
of the vaccine to the list, but it will take me some time to get it
from home in Greece...

For any info on the virus, don't hesitate!!!

This is not a virus, it is the infamous I-have-seen-too-many-disks bug
of the ADFS.  This is a bug in the directory cache management.  The
cure is to dismount disks properly after use, or to *Configure
ADFSDirCache 0k.

Of course, the PC Emulator does not suffer this, since it does not use
the ADFS.  A virus on the Arc is quite difficult to write, since it
can only be transferred by executable programs.  !Boot files are
easily checked for virus-like behaviour, and since there is no boot
sector (OS in ROM), boot-sector viri are impossible.  I have yet to
hear about the first Archimedes virus.

Subject: Viruses on an OS/2 server... (OS/2)

This may sound like and odd question, and I think I already know the
answer, but here goes.  Do I need to find any special virus scanners
to run on an OS/2 server?  Since, basically, OS/2 works on top of DOS,
I believe there is no need for special scanners, but I need to find
out.

Wild!  Can you (or anyone else) say how it does that?  For instance,
if the original file is

    A    B    C    D    E

how does it tell whether it's been infected by a virus like

    <jmp to virus> B C D E <virus> A

rather than a virus like

     <virus> C D E A B

or any of the other possibilities?   Sounds like a Hard

Sounds like a trashed System file. May have been garbled by a disk
error.  All of the other symptoms (distorted/garbled icons, dropouts,
crashes) are all likely in such a case. Other possibilities: an INIT
conflict.

Note:*this is normal*. It's what Apple calls a "switch-launch".
Running a program on a disk which contains a valid System and Finder
will cause the Mac to switch control to the new System and Finder.
Solution? Get rid of the other System files.

Recommendations: FTP a new copy of the system files from
apple.apple.com and replace your System folders. One trasehed System
could very well trash others. Don't unlock your disks when you use
them on someone else's machine.  Never, ever, use your originals of
*anything* unlocked. Copy it, then use it.

Subject: There is no SNEAK Virus (Mac)

If you find a "SNEAK" virus in TOPS using Interferon, it is more than
likely a false alarm. The SNEAK virus test looks for a particular pattern
of inter-segment calls and sets off an alarm if it finds it. This call
happens to be common to CODE-segment infectors, but it is valid for
a non-viral program to use it. TOPS does. If Disinfectant says it's not
infected, then it doesn't have any known virus. I'll leave it to a TOPS
expert to tell you what's really wrong.

Subject: How to setup a virus-prevention center

One of the things I'll have to deal with shortly is how to setup a
virus prevention center, basically an office of people ready to do
incident handling and some limited research.  We have a LOT of people
out there with PCs (the U.S. Gov) and don't want to get hounded with
false-alarm calls when a PC won't startup, etc.  It occurs to me that
this is an interesting "problem" if you will, and I haven't found much
written about it in practical terms - the document I worked on didn't
do a very good job of it.  If anyone has setup such a center and has
practical experience to share, I'd like to hear about it, with lots of
do's and don'ts hopefully.  It has been suggested to me that such a
center ought to be two-tiered, with a front office handling PC
problems, and then passing off the suspected virus situations to the
virus prevention center - the users don't call the prevention center
directly.  The center then works directly with the users or if
possible, deals thorugh the front office.  It seems to me that basic
research ought to include collection of statistics, knowledge of all
tools that are out there, and then some publishing oriented towards
the users.  Any expereince to share on this?

Subject: How easy would it be to contaminate a Unix Computer? (UNIX)

Since Unix can run on just about any computer from my Dinky '386 to a
Cray Supercomputer, wouldn't it be nearly impossible to write a virus
to corrupt Unix Binaries? You could target one system, or write a
virus to run on just one system, but spreading it would be somewhat
more difficult...

A worm, on the other hand, would be moderately less difficult (As has
already been demonstrated) since the mail systems are fairly
consistant from Unix to Unix. If a system administrator has been lax
with the security system, or mail should (GOD FORBID!) have bugs in it
that are easy to discover and take advantage of, one could, for
instance, uucp a bourne shell script or C shell script to a system and
then UUxqt it. Then it could replicate and replicate and replicate for
ever and ever.

With the world drifting toward consistancy in computers and their
operating systems, computers should be more succeptable to virii and
worms as a natural side effect of it being easier to write a program
that can just be recompiled and run on any environment.  So we'd
better make damn sure that the environment we finally decide to keep
(Binex, Written and Compiled in D?) has many good security functions
and that they are USED by the system administrators.  For instance, if
you set writepriv off on all executables, and have the operating
system prompt with a "Are you sure?" message if you try to change it,
that would probably help a lot.

Yeah... create an operating system impossible to infect with Virii,
move all American/Allied systems over to that, and then crank out
virii on the "Bad Guys" Ms Dos. $550000 Please ;-)

Subject: Some questions (PC)

Some questions I though I would toss out to the public.  They may/may not
have been asked before.

If you make a self-extracting archive (via PKZip, LHZ, PKArc, etc), what
would happen to that file if a virus managed to attach itself?  Would the
EXE file still extract (ie, get the files + a virus)?  Or would the archive
not extract, yet you still get an infection?  Perhaps none of the above?

Remote Boot Proms - What would happen if someone booted from an
infected disk (infecting your RAM with virus "x"), or ran a program
putting virus "x" into memory, then proceeded to CNTL-ALT-DEL to a
server using Remote Boot proms?  Ie, a Tolken Ring 16/4A card remotely
booting to a Novell NetWare 386 server.  Would that have any effect on
the virus?  The server? (assuming general user rights, not SU rights)
Other machines on the network?

Is there a list of virii that a general user might be able to infect a
server with?

How can reliable auto-validation be done?  Reading the disk image
fails if a virus feeds back the un-infected image and checksumming the
core image is awkward (to say the least) because of the changes made
by the loader when the program is relocated.  I ask because I'm
about to release a (PC) program with checking code which I know is
inadequate.

I think it would be exceedingly difficult to develop a virus that
could be considered a reliable tactical weapon.  However, I do think
that computer sabotage of all types, including spreading viruses,
could be an effective strategic weapon in an extended conflict.  I
wonder how the US compares to the Soviets in their dependence on
computers and their computers' vulnerability to attack.

Subject: Re #88:Computer Virus Catalog?

For all those interested to receive the next edition (and future ones) of the
Computer Virus Catalog:

        1. the next edition will be mailed *early in June*; we are working
           very hard on it, but we have been overloaded with some serious
           virus cases, which diminished our time available for cataloguing
           viruses; I hope that you understand *our priority `analysis of new
           esp. serious attacks before documentation of known ones'*; among
           others, SUNDAY and 5120 recently detected in FRG, will be catalogued
;
           the next edition will contain
               about 15 MsDos virii (then, 47 MsDos virii catalogued)
               about 10 Atari virii (then, 16 Atari virii catalogued), and
               14 more Amiga virii + updates of the published 24 virii.
           Moreover, we hope to publish, probably later in June, *about 10
           MacVirii*, most of which with the aid of David Ferbrache, but some
           by our MacVirii group (which we *installed today, 8-May-1990*, under
           the impression of a heavy nVirB-accident in the European printing
           industry, and with the aid of Apple Germany which gives us a MAC
           for this work, as our Faculty refused to give us a Mac `because
           virus analysis should be done by the industry', and 'virus analysis
           is not sufficiently scientific', as some of our theoreticians
           and hardware specialists argued in the finance committee!).

         2. As the number of virii grows strongly, we face the need to produce
            the *Computer Virus Catalog in a machine-readable form* which may
            be used, with a proper (relational) databank, to enquire a possible
            virus infection. To this end, we are presently discussing a formal
            *Threat Description Language/Virii* which was developed from the
            actual Virus Catalog Format (version 1.2). This work is essentially
            done by Morton Swimmer. After `internal discussions', we plan to
            publish the preliminary version and 10-15 virii mid-July,1990. We
            will send this to Virus-L, and we hope that you help us to validate
            the format until September. We then hope to produce an updated
            machine-readable format (2.0) in November 1990, and we hope then
            to have a C-based classification/query system (installed on a Sun)
            ready for distribution. (Future plans include a semi-automatic
            classification system).

         3. Following our practice, new versions will be announced on Virus-L.

         4. Those mail servers interested in the new editions should inform me
            (adresses below); I will place such adresses on our mailing list.

What is most interesting is the high number of 1704 infections -

Also interesting is the lack of any Vienna infections (other than the

VGA.  It's very good for presentations or virus training (it's in full
color) and it covers most major virus issues - background, types of
viruses, prevalence, infection mechanisms, network issues, protection
techniques, etc., etc.  Runs for about an hour if you are talking
someone through it.  It's big tho (>200K zipped) so allow plenty of
time for the download.

I must have seen the same article.  Here it is, as it appeared in
the "Syracuse Herald American" newspaper, Sunday May 6, 1990.

*** COMPUTER BUG SOUGHT BY ARMY
**  $500,000 prize awaits best virus
*   By Rory J. O'Connor
    Knight-Ridder news service

The U.S. Army is looking for help to develop the seeds of new-age
germ warfare:  It wants business to help it turn computer "viruses"
into military weapons.

Experts predict the viruses, if successfully developed, could be
used to wreak havoc on the increasing number of computers in the
battlefield.  The destructive computer programs, which have
increasingly damaged commercial and research computer systems in
the past four years, could be used to disrupt military communications,
impede the control of weapons and feed misleading data to enemy
commanders.

The viruses could also be used to alter the programming of crucial
communications satellites serving combat units, the experts said.

The Army is soliciting bids from small businesses to determine the
feasibility of using computer viruses in warfare.  And it is willing
to pay as much as $550,000 to a company that comes up with a plan
for creating the programs -- and figures out how to use military
radio systems to introduce them into enemy computers.

A computer virus is a kind of program designed to disrupt normal
operations of a computer system or damage data on that system by
altering or destroying it.  The rogue programs are most effective
when introduced secretly into the computer system of an unsuspecting
user and when their damage is subtle or hidden from the user for
some time.

Viruses are also self-duplicating and can spread undetected from
an infected computer to other computer systems they contact.  So
far, more than 60 computer viruses have been identified, most of
them attacking poorly guarded personal computers used by businesses,
universities and individuals.  The Army's virus would have to be
more sophisticated than those programs.

But some detractors of the concept say the Army could wind up with
the same problem it has with biological weapons: creating destructive
elements that might get loose and cause widespread damage to its
own forces as well as civilians.

"This stuff is very dangerous, and most people involved in creating
viruses are not aware of the threat," said a Bay Area virus expert
who asked not to be named.  "You can't spread anthrax around the
world and not have it come back around to you.  And the enemy is
using the same kind of computers and software that we are."

Many experts who are fighting the explosion in virus activity by
amateur programmers are especially angry at government efforts to
develop the programs for the military.  Some say it is particularly
troubling in light of Friday's sentencing of Robert T. Morris Jr.,
convicted in federal court of sending a similar program through
a government-sponsored computer network in 1988.

"It bothers me that the government says in one breath (viruses)
are bad and illegal and then asks for someone to develop them,"
said Glenn Tenney, a San Mateo, Calif., programmer and organizer
of the annual computer Hackers Conference.  "If Morris had done
the same thing for the Army, they'd have paid him hundreds of
thousands to do it.  But he did it on the wrong side and got
punished."

Morris was sentenced in Syracuse Friday by Federal Judge Howard
Munson to a $10,000 fine, three years of probation and 400 hours
of community service.

The Army's bid solicitation, titled "Computer Virus Electronic
Counter Measure," was written by the Army's Signals Warfare
Laboratory.  It appears in the most recent collection of similar
bid requests published by the government's Small Business Innovation
Research Program.

The Army would pay the winning bidder up to $50,000 to analyze
the feasibility of creating the virus, said Joyce Crisci, the Army
administrator for the project at Fort Monmouth, N.J.  If that study
is accepted, the company could get as much as $500,000 in research
and development money.

Crisci declined to provide further technical details of the project,
saying such information could prejudice the bidding process.

However, computer experts said creating a virus such as that sought
by the Army was possible with current technology -- although some
of the Army's requirements could make developing it more difficult
than creating an ordinary personal computer virus.

  Sorry, but this idea came from lots of Science Fiction books (the
Cyberpunks, as Michael Gibson's THE NEUROMANCER), and short stories.
As the Pentagonon is dealing with Artificial Reality, Networks and
security (all at the same time, all SciFi stuff), they must be doing
something like that.

  Actually, I believe they must be doing it just now, if not to attack
"enemyes" computers, to study and avoid attacks to their own.
