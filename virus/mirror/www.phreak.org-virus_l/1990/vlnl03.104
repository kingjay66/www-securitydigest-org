VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: KEYBGR virus on PC's found (PC)

Some days ago we detected another new effect on our machines.
The virus appeared at the first time here in Duesseldorf, West Germany.
Does anybody else around know these following facts:

- -- modified version of the German Keyboard driver KEYBGR.COM
   for use with DOS 2.10

- -- Length changed from 1573 (original) bytes to 2013 (modified) bytes
   date of modified version changed to June 6, 1989.

- -- After starting KEYBGR via AUTOEXEC (or later) a smile face
   -ASCII 1- appears after a time of 2 minutes on the screen
   and starts its random walk across the screen (one second per move)

- -- When going on a new screen position it replaces the character on
   this position with the face and puts the original character on that
   place where the face was one step ago.
   If you are waiting a few minutes the screen is completely trashed.

- -- No printout of trashed screen is possible (Sorry, no example can
   be shown here!); PrtSc only produces the original screen.

- -- No comment, no output text appears on the screen.
   Looks like any other keyboard driver too.

- -- No other action known - seems that it is one of the harmless
   viruses (i.e. no FAT or File destruction).

For discussion:
Although it looks like this is "only" a screen modifying program
I would be interested if the other subscribers of VIRUS-L think
that the group of programs to which this modified KEYBGR belongs
are viruses or not. My opinion about this is that I would call
it a virus just because of the fact that it replaces the
regular keyboard driver which is really part of the standard
programs one starts with every system boot.

Please tell me your suggestions (to me or to the list).

Yours,
        Stephan Joest    (JOEST at DD0RUD81.BITNET)

Subject: Jerusalem B (PC)

Bad News   :-(

We have discovered Jerusalem B on many of our micros.  This is the first
recorded occurence here, but you should be wary of diskettes/files which
may be coming to you from our site.  The infection "seems" to have been
confined to two of our four "Users' Areas" so we have probably caught it
before *much* spreading.

Subject: Does write-protection work?

SOME TIMES AGO I READ THAT IS POSSIGLE A VIRUS INFECT A DISKETTE
PHISICALLY PROTECTED.  I KNOW IT IS AN OLD DISCUSSION BUT IS IT REALLY
POSSIBLE ?

[Ed. Yes, this discussion has come up a few times before.  After much
heated discussion, the consensus was that (on a PC), the write
protection is implemented by hardware in the floppy disk drive
(according to the IBM Tech. Ref. schematics).  At least in the case of
PCs, I urge us to consider this matter closed unless someone can come
up with conclusive proof to the contrary (i.e., send me a piece of
source code that proves it).]

Please consider posting this file to comp.binaries.mac for those who do not
have FTP access. Furthermore if the documents are good enough they will be
worth the largest possible dissemination.

Subject: Three possibly new viruses lost !!!! (PC)

Hi,
  we were contacted during the last week by 3 persons / institutions
reporting the following symptoms:
 #1: (large company) on one of their PCs (used by several people) they
     suddenly found all of their COM files in the root directory being
     replaced by 204 byte long text files (the names were still the old
     ones e.g. COMMAND.COM) the text is a french translation of a
     Edgar Allen Poe poem. (4 lines)
 #2: (mid size industrial company) they ran Lotus and all of a sudden
     the printer started and printed the last lines of McAfee's scan
     message (This program may not be used in .....) reverse order
     (right to left). And it played a tune possibly Yankee Doodle Dandy
 #3: (reporting person did not disclose company) A small ambulance car
     drawn with block graphic characters moved across the screen and played
     a sirene sound on the speaker.

In all three cases the victims destroyed the sabotage code be it a virus or
trojan by using a low level format. In case #3 they even found out that it
was a virus of 799 bytes length, but did not keep a sample.

A low level format might get rid of the virus on a particular machine but
if one can't search for the cause of these effects there is a high probability
that these things reappear and cause malfunctions again. Also such a virus or
trojan may not only affect executable code it might also affect data files.
Only a disassembly and expert investigation can reveal such doings.

If anyone has seen or heard of the above described effects should contact me.
Thanks in advance
   Christoph Fischer

Subject: Re: Military Virus and SciFi books

If you want the cyberpunks' view, please ask a similiar question in
the newsgroup alt.cyberpunk.  In case you don't already know, VR
viruses are talked about in many cyberpunk books.  The premier
cyberpunk book in Neuromancer by William Gibson.  In this book a virus
is unleased that contains information so dense that it creates a
"virtual black hole."

Another possibilty for VR viruses is a program that attacks users, not
computers.  For the most effective VR, a user must be "plugged in" to his
computer, so that all sensory input is from VR.  If the user is
completely jacked in, a nice little sensory overload could effectively
kill or maybe just maim.

Like I say, for a look at future viruses, just go ask the console cowboys.

I am making a complete set of indexes to the messages in Virus-L so far. In
the course of doing this, I have found that both the UK  and  USA  archived
copies of Virus-L vol1 #13 are truncated partway through its first message.
If  anyone  out  there  has a complete copy or listing of Virus-L vol1 #13,
please send me a copy or listing  or  photocopy  of  it,  by  email  or  by

Have received several inquiries following my comments concerning this
paper from people wanting copies. The paper is the property of
FoundationWare in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Domestic telephone numbers are
(800)722-8737 or (216)752-8181. I do not know if it is available
electronically.

Incidently Dr. Tippett is scheduled to be a featured speaker at the CSI
conference here in Orlando 18-21 June. I believe his talk is scheduled for
Monday morning - for information contact CSI @ (415)267-7666 (San Francisco)

While straigtening things out, could we agree on a common name for this
virus.  David (IBM VIRUSCAN) refers to it as the "1813", people who use
John McAfee's SCAN find it referred to as the "Jerusalem-B". They are
one and the same.
