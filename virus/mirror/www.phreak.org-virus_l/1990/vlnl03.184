VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

My wife is the publications editor for a charitable organization.
In connection with a journal they are working on, they will be
receiving floppies from authors all over the U.S. (and possibly
elsewhere).  They may also be sending out floppies for review by
content editors, etc.

I expressed concern that they might very well be laying themselves wide
open to god-knows-what in the way of viruses/worms/whatever.  I also
thought that they could act as a very efficient spreader of these same
nasties to other unsuspecting victims.  Their local "expert" told them
that they had nothing to worry about, but that if "something happened"
to call him and he would "fix it".

QUESTIONS:
    Is my concern valid, even if they only read/write files in MS Word
	format (or Wordperfect or ??)?

    If it is valid:
	What is out there that they need to look out for?
	How do they detect it?
	How do they fix it?
	Can they (should they?) perform checking/sanitizing on a
	    machine on the net or on an isolated machine?
	Is there a source of information on this (book/mag/etc)?

The environment in question is a network of machines (mostly HP Vectras
+ some others) connected by ethernet, running DOS and applications such
as Word, Wordperfect, Lotus 1-2-3, some-sort-of-e-mail, etc.

Please e-mail any help you can offer.

I was recently advised to watch out for a trojan in a SCANV70.ZIP file,
does anyone have any more info on this?  I have heard that it is pretty
nasty, what does it do?

Padgett Peterson reported a possible windows trojan in October.  Has this
been confirmed?  The reported trojan was call curse.exe from an archive
called wincurs.zip.  Thanks

I totally agree. But the executable file you download doesn't have to be
infected at the FTP source to get you. Let me explain: I downloaded a Self-
Extracting Archive (something I loathe to do) from wuarchive directly to
a clean floppy on a PC at school. But what I didn't know was that the
PC was infected. When I brought the program home to my PC, all ^%#* broke
loose. I too thought that wuarchive had an infected file. But I checked things
out, and old Typhoid Mary PC at school was the culprit.

The moral? Always work in archive files (quite hard/impossible to infect
if the files are orifinally clean) and check, check, check everything
when you get it out of the archive.

[This one has been corrected to include the submission address.]

			   Call for Papers
	   4th Annual Computer Virus & Security Conference
		 March 14 & 15, 1991 in New York City

	  Sponsored by the DPMA Financial Industries Chapter
		  In Cooperation with ACM SIGSAC and
		   The Computer Society of the IEEE


The 4th Annual Computer Virus and Security Conference will feature more
than thirty speakers on the topics of computer viruses and "vandalware,"
computer law, and computer security.  Approximately twenty are well-known
experts in the field, and fifteen or more will be selected on the basis of
submitted papers.

Held on Thursday and Friday (Ides of March) at the New York World
Trade Center, this major event features:

    * Identification of latest threats to SNA, DEC, PC, MAC, X.25
	 and UNIX.

    * Tools and Techniques: What the major corporations are doing.

    * Specific Countermeasures: From labs, other companies, commercial
	vendors.

The Conference traditionally covers recent outbreaks and experiments;
virus/intruder prevention, detection and recovery; product
demonstrations and ratings; and special attention to LAN, PBX, SNA,
OSI, E-Mail, and legal issues.

This year's focus topics are as follows:

    * Prevention, detection and recovery from viruses and other harmful
	computer programs.

    * Original research on these and related topics.

    * Recovery from the Wall Street Blackout and the Novell Virus.

    * Case studies of computer and network security.

    * Surveys of products and techniques available.

    * Computer crime and related actions.

The bound Proceedings will include both the accepted papers and also
discursive articles by the invited speakers. There will be four
concurrent conference tracks each day:

    Thursday will feature the Main Track, Products Track, Research
    Papers, and a special Trap & Prosecute track geared to law
    enforcement and criminal justice personnel.

    Friday will feature Main, Products, and Research tracks, and a How
    to Recover track strongly requested by returning attendees from
    last year.

In the past, this conference has been featured in BYTE, CIO, Communications
(ACM), Computer (IEEE), Computerworld, Data Communications, Data Center
Manager, Datamation, Info World, Macintosh News, MIS Week, Network World,
and Unix Review. It is sponsored by the Data Processing Management
Association Financial Industries Chapter in cooperation with ACM SIGSAC and
the IEEE Computer Society.

Attendees may make use of discount airfares (43% off Continental) from
anywhere to New York, including both adjoining weekends.  The Penta
Hotel (formerly Statler Hilton) has reserved a block of Conference
rooms at $89 per night. Conference itself includes luncheon and
quarter-mile-high hospitality at Windows on the World Restaurant.

Target audience includes MIS Directors, Security Analysts, Software
Engineers, Operations Managers, Academic Researchers, Technical Writers,
Criminal Investigators, Hardware Manufacturers, and Lead Programmers.
Registration (202-371-1013) costs $275 for one day, $375 for both, with a
$25 discount for members of cooperating organizations (DPMA, ACM, IEEE-CS).

Submissions to the conference may be either as an extended abstract or a
draft final paper.  Four copies of each submission should be *received* by
the program chair no later than Tuesday, January 8, 1991.  Each submission
must contain a brief abstract (approx. 200 words), and a header identifying
the names, affiliation, address, and e-mail address (optional) of all
authors.  Successful submitters or co-authors are expected to present in
person.  Decisions will be announced by Feb. 12, 1991.  Submissions
should be mailed to:

I have sent this gentleman a bit of code to fix the problem.  There
has been a fix posted on the virus archives.  I have slightly
rewritten the fix, so it is more informative, and doesn't take a
Postscript Guru to make work 8).  Last time I offered the fix over the
net, I got inundated with requests.  The code that I currently am
sending out, is safe.  you only can get a printout of your eeprom with
it, and a report of exactly what the password is.  You then can reset
it useing Postscript's normal resetting code.

Cheers
Woody

p.s. The following is a revised version of the password READER code.
The hex stuff is ascii encoded 68000 machine code.  This one is MUCH
cleaner, and NOT encoded like the first one was.  This one is my
routine with the dangerous i.e. write any location code removed.  It
also has had a minor bug fix made.  (I left out a line that begins the
user dictionary) consequently things didnot work just right.  That has
been fixed.

Cheers
Woody

% This code does not change the password of the laserprinter.  Instead
% it reads the contents of the eeprom and prints it out to the page,
% as well as returning it to the com port.  You then may use the
% normal password setting mechanism in the printer to set the password
% to whatever you wish.  This modification to the routines make this
% far less dangerous, as you cannot alter any location in the eeprom
% directly this way.  All it allows you to do is to read the eeprom.

% What follows is the cexec code.  This is 68000 machine language
% for Adobe Postscript.  It has to be executed from within the context
% of an eexec, so we define a procedure named #. that is executed from
% a short encrypted string using eexec.  This obviates the need to
% encrypt the entire program.
%
% This is intended to be a safe password resetter routine.
%
% My thanks to Nigel for this idea (only showing you the password)...
%
% this installs 3 routines.
%
% printeprom	prints the eprom to the page
% dumpeprom	prints the eprom to the serial link
% readpassword	reads the password and leaves it on top of the stack.
