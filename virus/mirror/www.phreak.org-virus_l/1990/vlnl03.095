VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I downloaded ACS Virus scan from simtel20 and by doing a
avs c:\ /a /e  I'm told I have the 12 Trick type B virus.
However, Scan soes not show this, plus it also said this about
my brand new copy of PCTOOLS Version 6.0

My question, does AVS give false signals?  I find it hard to belive
Central Point would be distributing a virus.  It only appears in the
pc-cache.com, descktop.exe and hotkey.ovl.  However, every copy I
checked showed this type of virus.  For example, my masters to 5.5 and
6.0 showed this along with my back ups.

Help.

It seems very likely that the system distribution disks, or something
else, was infected at some point. I have used a Macintosh portable
since January, and protected it with Virex, which detected neither
virus nor trojan horse under 6.0.4 or 6.0.5...the former system came
with the machine, the latter was downloaded from a BBS. Your friend
should update his system to 6.0.5, by the way, because it incorporate
a few important bug fixes, such as better control of the serial ports
after coming out of the sleep mode.

This seems very similar to a program called PANIC.EXE which was included on
the WHAT PERSONAL COMPUTER Magazine disk (UK), issue for March 1990.  It is
included along with five other 'joke' programs.  The programs on this  disk
are indeed jokes, i.e. not viruses, their details are:
ALIENMES.EXE     30224    9-01-87     1:32p
APRIL.EXE         2890   14-03-87    10:16p

Subject: DOS viruses under OS/2 (PC)

Here is a very important question which I have not yet seen answered
authoritatively:

Could any of the common DOS viruses (e.g., Jerusalem, Stoned) execute,
infect other programs or disks, and do their diry work when run in the
DOS comaptibility box of OS/2?  We will assume that IOPL=YES.  I
imagine separate consideration should be given to boot-sector viruses
and program-infecting viruses.  I do not want to be able to answer
this question from first-hand experience.

Subject: Possible bug in CleanUp V62 (PC)

Hello,

I have found two machines around here infected with the 4096 virus.  I
have used an older version of cleanup (V60) on one of the machines and
it seems to have gotten rid of the virus and left some of the files
corrupted.  On the other machine I have used CleanUp V62.  When
running SCAN, after a power off and on, there were still files which
scan claimed to be infected.  Another run of CleanUp simply corrupted
all these files.  Any explanation???

Subject: Bogus SCAN.EXE (PC)

A file called SCAN.ZIP has been uploaded to one of the BBSs here,
in Israel. I noticed that the file was very small (about 7K of ZIP)
and the description said that it can detect 103 viruses. I, ofcourse,
downloaded this file and checked it right away. This program seems
to be identical to SCAN.EXE from first look except for two things:
1. The bogus SCAN was not written in C - it's write_to_screen routine
is much faster than the real SCAN's one. 2. The screen is cleared
before the bogus SCAN.EXE activates itself. The bogus SCAN size is
28720 bytes long - much smaller than the original one. The version of
this bogus SCAN is 9.4V65. When you execute SCAN C: for instance, it
seems to work fine - It scanns the memory (much faster than usual,
tough - false check) and starts checking the files (also, much faster).
The reason for the quick files scan is that the files are actually
being replaced with a 14 bytes text file which contains the message:
"Next time...". Note that this file came as a stand alone file without
all the documentations and validation program. Also note that all
the messages from the real SCAN has been copied to the bogus SCAN. Just
from looking at the messages, you can't tell if it's a real SCAN or a
bogus one (you can always check the version number, though).

I do not think that this file will not leave Israel but I would like
to warn everyone, anyway.

If SUM reports that he has nVIR on his machine, then he almost certainly
has nVIR on his machine.  The Portable has no particular compatibility
problems that would show up with SUM.

I would strongly suspect that, like all other such cases so far, his
system has had "outside" contact.  His system distribution disks, if they
came with the Portable and were absolutely positively not used before,
were not infected.  This is a big assumption; for instance, did his dealer
do any setup on the machine?

Apple spends an enormous amount of time and effort to ensure that software
distributed with our machines is not infected in any way.  The Portable
Macintoshes that our group has received direct from the same distribution
channels as end users have no infections.

You can get an upgrade to SUM II by calling Symantec.  The number is in
the documentation accompanying SUM.

It does not sound like a virus.  What is in your autoexec?  What type
of machine do you have?  Sounds more like a compatibility problem,
hard ware bug, or soft- ware bug.  Personally I think that the virus
scare is a little overstated.  I am not ruling it out, but I really
don't think you are infected.

Try this:

Edit your autoexec.bat and turn ECHO on.  This way all of the commands
will showon the screen.  Each time your computer reboots itself, take
note of where in the autoexec it occurred.  If it is the same place
each time, then it is probably not a virus.

Subject: new virus detection time (Mac)

How long does a virus have to be in the general population before it is
detected?  Does it have to reach a research center before it's noticed?

(Right now my backspace key doesn't work, my hard drive free space
fluctuates by two megs, sometimes my inits won't load on bootup, and the
computer will reboot without warning for no apparent reason... this
could be explained by indiscriminate use of ResEdit back in January)

I think I can explain all the above symptoms, and repair via a reformat
and download from backups.  But then, many Mac virus systems can be
explained as a "bad system file" or "memory resident program conflicts".

So, how long does a bug have to go around before it is detected?
