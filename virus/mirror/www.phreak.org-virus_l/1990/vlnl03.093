Subject: RE: Military Viruses (THE FACTS)

After reading, in astonishment, Nick DiGionanni's input regarding
Military Viruses, (VIRUS-L 3-90 8 May 90) the phone lines were burning
up from my office to the DOD Information Systems Security Management
Office checking on the validity of the story. No one had even heard of
such a project being undertaken. A few more phone calls later
generated a FAX to my desk of an article from the Phildelphia Inquirer
titled, "Army Searches for new weapon: Computer Virus", written by
Rory J.  O'Connor.  The article quoted an individual as being the
adminstrator of the project. Now the hunt started to locate her.
Within a few hours I had her on the phone.  Needless to say, the
reporter identified himself as a small businessman and was interested
in this program.  The information given to him was completely turn
around so that he could make a big story out of nothing.

HERE ARE THE FACTS:  The Department of Defense published a booklet titled,
"PROGRAM SOLICITATION 90.2  FY-1990 SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH
(SBIR) PROGRAM".  On page 45 can be found the following:
A90-217  TITLE: Computer Virus Electronic Counter Measure (ECM)
CATEGORY:  Exploratory Development
OBJECTIVE: The objective shall be to determine the potential for using
"computer viruses" as an ECM technique against generic military
communications systems/nets.  The goal shall be to determine the
feasibility of remotely introducing a virus into a system/net and
analyzing its effects on various subsystem components.
DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this research shall be to investigate
potential use of computer viruses to achieve traditional
communications ECM effects in targeted communications systems.  These
effects can include data (information) disruption, denial, and
deception, but other effects should also be researched such as
executable code in processors, memory storage mamagement, etc.
Research in effective methods or strategies to remotely introduce such
viruses shall also be conducted.  Efforts in this area should be
focused on RF atmospheric signal transmission shch as performed in
tactical military data communications.

It continues on to explain what needs to be accomplished in each phase.

As you can see, this is nothing more than a feasability study to
answer the famous "WHAT IF WE COULD ?????" question.  Admittedly,
myself and many of my collegues are quite suprised that something of
this nature would be put on the streets for research and not using the
expertise internally available.

Hello!

I don't know whether a virus can infect a self-extracting archive, but
I assume it is possible.  However, the virus can only infect the
receiver's computer when the self-extractor is actually run.  For that
reason, I always check self-extracting archives with a virus-scanner
before running them.  And then, if the components include programs, I
check the extracted programs as well.  Better safe than sorry!

Perhaps the folk on Virus-L will be able to shed light on the question?

Best wishes,

Note that FSHIELD cannot restore already infected file! It protects
the file! If the file changes, FSHIELD tells you and you can restore
the original file if you want. Also note that the shareware version
does not have a device driver which is included in the registered
version. The device driver can also check if files were changed even
if the 4096 virus or any other stealth virus is in memory.  About your
question, FSHILED does not know how the virus is on the file! It only
restores it.  It of course cannot remove viruses which overwrite the
beginning of the file but does not have the original at the end. But
then, there is no anti-viral software (and there will be not) which
can remove this kind of viruses (i.e. LEHIGH).

Subject: McAfee's SCAN v61 and Zenith 386SX (PC)

Hi:

I'm trying to use the McAfee SCAN program (version 3.1v61) in our
computer lab.  It works wonderfully with the IBM XT's and PS/2's, but
seems to have a problem with our new, snazzy Zenith 386SX's.  When it
goes to scan the hard drive (C:), it says, "I can't figure out the
sector size" (or words to that effect), and goes on to say, "Do you
have a hard drive C:?"  The 386SX has a 42MB hard drive (Zenith drive
type 44).  What do I need to do to get SCAN (or whatever program) to
look for viruses on the hard drive?  The whole 42MB is a single
partition, thanks to Zenith's MS-DOS 3.3 plus.

Any advice or horror stories are welcome.  Thanks in advance for any
assistance you can give me.

Did you also see the New Generation episode (the title escapes me now)

required them to shutdown everything but life support, startup with

Yeeech, what a scarrry thought!  Not only does it spawn into other
programs, but spawns more infective processes while it's running.
Sounds a lot like what the Star Trek: The New Generation virus did,
since I believe their memory banks are primary storage rather than
disk or tape.

From:    Y. Radai <RADAI1@HBUNOS.BITNET>
Subject: Re: Universal Virus Detector

  Now that I finally have some time, I'd like to post my comments on
the paper by Chris Ruhl and James Molini, "A Universal Virus Detection
Model", an extended abstract of which appeared in V3 #71.  (Note: The
quotations which I reproduce below are from the full paper.  Several
of them are absent from the abstract.)

  I agree with the general idea of using a checksum type of detector
and I appreciate the effort which the authors have made in formulating
it in terms of a model.  Nevertheless, I think that in many respects
they have put the emphasis on the wrong points.  I'll mention here
only the most important of my disagreements:

  1.  In my opinion, the measures proposed by the authors are either
too little or too much, depending on which part of the paper one looks
at.  Let's start with the "too little" part:

>So to put our theoretical UVD into practice, on, for example, an IBM
>PC, we would do the following:
>.....
>b.  Validate the integrity of the read process by checking the
>    interrupt table and low memory for changes.  This would stop the

A memory-resident virus does not have to modify any interrupt vectors.
What better example than the very one they name, the 4096 (which in-
stead overwrites the first few bytes of an existing handler with a
jump to its own routine)?
  The surest way to ensure that memory (not only low memory, but *all*
of RAM) is uninfected when the detection program is run is to keep the
program and its database on a bootable diskette, and then to run the
program only from that diskette and only immediately after cold-boot-
ing from that diskette.
  (Russell Wallace claims that most users would consider this unaccep-
table hassle.  But if the checksum program is what I have called in
previous postings the "static" type, then it's unnecessary to run it
more than once per boot or per day, or even per week.  I don't consi-
der that unacceptable hassle at all.)

  True, the authors do say something like the above in their full
paper when they write:
>                              The following methods attempt to validate
>the integrity of the detection code, or stored tables:
>
>a.  Run the detector from a write-protected, bootable floppy, thus
>    assuring a validated run time environment and providing a constant
>    set of scan pointers.
> .....

  But the wording here (and in many other places in the paper) seems
to me so unclear that I confess I have no idea whether the authors
actually intend to implement Method (a) or not.  If they do, why isn't
this important instruction mentioned in their abstract and in their
steps for "putting their theoretical UVD into practice"?  The reason
that this measure is important is that if they do implement it, then
most of the remaining precautions (e.g. validating the integrity of
the read and output processes and prepending the set of dynamic state
vectors) become unnecessary.  And if they do not implement it, then
their measures are insufficient.  In the one case, it's too much; in
the other it's too little.

  2.  The authors write
>                                           Any program which
>circumvents the modification of existing code is not a virus.

Well, that may be correct *formally*, according to their definition of
a virus.  But from a practical point of view, I think it's the wrong
approach, since under DOS one can construct replicating programs which
do not modify existing code (hence may not be viruses according to
their definition), yet which may get executed.  Moreover, they could
be detected by a properly constructed detection program.  To ignore
detectable pathogenic programs on the grounds that they don't fit the
authors' definition of a virus  is unrealistic.

  3.  They also write:
>                                            (Insert your favorite
>Checksum/CRC/Cryptographic routine here.)

This parenthetical remark requires a lot of elaboration.  If we
represent the checksumming routine by F, then at the very least
the following conditions should be satisfied:
  (A) For any given file f, F(f) is (in general) different for each
computer.  (This condition amounts essentially to requiring a key
which is chosen randomly or personally by each user.)
  (B) Given a file f, it is computationally infeasible (without know-
ledge of the key) to construct a file f' from it containing the de-
sired addition of (or replacement of ordinary code by) viral code such
that F(f') = F(f).

Subject: Computer Warfare / Software Sabotage

While "viruses" may not be particularly effective tactical weapons, and
sending them over radio links may be impractical, software sabotage in
general seems like a much more plausible military application.

Assuming agents (CIA, Special Forces, etc.) can get behind enemy lines
to tap into the enemy's computer network, they could do quite a bit of
damage using worms, trojan horses, and time bombs -- especially if these
programs were set to go off in conjunction with a conventional (or
nuclear?) military offensive.  Being able to fix the damage to your C3I
system in a matter of days is fairly irrelevant if a major offensive is
taking place _right_now_.

I think this would be very dangerous. Everyone who knows the basics of
modern military systems can tell you that in order to avoid (if is
possible at all|) the global holocaust, each conflicting part MUST NOT
disrupt the enemy command, control and communications. If used in a
nuclear exchange, such virii could raise down to zero the ability of
the conflicting countries' commanders to keep the situation under
control. This would be suicide.

For macs, I receive a new virus checker every few months which checks
for a couple of new viruses.  I expect the situation would be worse
with ibm-pcs.  Do you think it would be reasonable to have everyone
reprogram their eproms (or receive new ones) every few months?  This

I'm sure you could really confuse things by uploading a program to their
satelites with slightly altered code.  But this wouldn't be classified
as a computer virus.

Sounds like they don't know what they are talking about maybe?  Also, don't
viruses take months to spread?  Doesn't sound like a battlefield weapon!

However, I remember reading an article (sorry don't remember where -
Mass. high tech.?) explaining how a virus was successfully used to win
a mock battle among Australian soldiers.  The type of mock battle that
uses real guns, tanks, radios, and battle computers - but fake
bullets.  I think they said they used a modified version of the STONED
virus.  Probably the virus was set to trigger at the same time as when
the team made their main attack.

No .SYS infecting file is known today, but I am expecting one soon.  The
reason:  I received a call from a person in Iceland who said he had been
infected with such a thing and asked me if I would like a copy.  Of course I
replied "Yes, sure" and he promised to send me a copy by mail.  This was a
couple of weeks ago, and nothing has arrived yet.  He had given me his name,
but not his phone number, so I attempted to locate him, by looking him up in
the national registery.  However, I found out that nobody with this name
exists in Iceland.  A fake name - a non-appearing virus......either it was
a joke or the person who called me is writing such a virus.  If so, I even
consider it fairly likely that he may be the author of the other Icelandic
viruses.

> Are there any anti-viral PC products which load/activate via the CONFIG.SYS?

Quite a few, actually.  The anti-virus program by T.P. (the author of
the Vacsina/Yankee Doodle series of viruses) is one.  It had the name of
'VACSINA', which some of his viruses checked for, which was the reason
the string 'VACSINA' appeared in the Vacsina virus.

My own F-PROT package contains another .SYS file, a small 2000 byte program
that monitors the execution of other programs and will stop any known virus,
just display a message like

              This program is infected with the ......... virus
              Access denied

when an attempt is made to run an infected program.

As you say, the big plus with .SYS files is that they are currently immune to
viruses, and are activated before any program virus gets run.

I have no doubt that several other .SYS anti-virus products exist as well.

They could, yes - but any modified EPROM could be made to appear normal, so it
would not be of any use.

I use to  say: there are no impossibilities in  electronic data processing but
some things take helluva time.
There are backdoors and  holes in operating systems and when  you know one you
can often easily exploit them. Even then it  is not a simple task to develop a
true virus. You  may be able to  crash remote systems, fake  addresses or send
Trojans around.  Being a  VM and MVS  systems programmer I  can only  speak of
these systems. From experience I'm more worried about software bugs than about
viruses.
There are other things making virus-writing complicated. On a pc you have full
control  over the  environment and  can play  whatever tricks  you want.  On a
mainframe it's near to impossible to have the environment under your exclusive
control. It takes  a fair amount of  time to run the required  tests and after
that you probably have to restore the system to it's former state.

I admit that a clever virus *could* go unnoticed for sufficient time. But it's
rather unlikely that the *developement* of  the virus would - unless the whole
systems group is taking part.
Well, 'nuf said for now, I'll wait for comments
Christian
