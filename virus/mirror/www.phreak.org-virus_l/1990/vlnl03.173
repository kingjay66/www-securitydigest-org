VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

All of the files in my comm directory deleted themselves in one fell
swoop.  I was able to unerase them and run the comm program again.
This time beautiful graphics began scrolling by.  It was geometric,
scrolled upward, contained many different patterns, some of them
looked like rockets.  It continued for several minutes.  I tried a
soft reboot without success.  A hard reboot worked.  Everything seems
OK.  I ran Norton Utilities Sysinfo on the disk.  I noticed one of the
hardware interrupts is named [Cascade].  I seem to remember reading
about a virus of this name.  FYI, the interrupt looks like this:

IRQ 02 0c28:0219 [Cascade] DOS System Area

Do I have a bug?  (I sure had something out of the ordinary!)
Is there anything I can do to get rid of it without
buying software?
Thanks for your help,
Connie

Subject: "Common" viruses (PC)

The following is a list of those viruses considered "common" as of
September 1990 as extracted from Pamela Hoffman's VSUM9010. As may be
seen, the list has now increased to 21 with the Stoned accounting for
most of the sightings (subjective judgement) at present. In each case,
the primary name is given first, followed by other names that the
virus is known as (e.g. Jerusalem - 1813). I am surprised that the
Brain & Ashar still make the "common" list.

I would suggest that newcomers to Virus-L review available literature
on these contageons prior to asking for a "dump" or reporting a "new"
virus.

 4096 aka Century Virus, FroDo, IDF Virus, Stealth Virus, 100 Years Virus
 AirCop
 Ashar aka Shoe_Virus, UIUC Virus
 Brain aka Pakistani, Pakistani Brain
 Cascade aka Fall, Falling Letters, 1701, 1704
 Cascade-B aka Blackjack, 1704-B
 Dark Avenger aka Black Avenger, Eddie, Diana
 Den Zuk aka Search, Venezuelan
 Disk Killer aka Computer Ogre, Disk Ogre, Ogre
 Jerusalem aka PLO, Israeli, Friday 13th, Russian, 1813(COM), 1808(EXE)
 Jerusalem B aka Arab Star, Black Box, Black Window, Hebrew University
 Joshi aka Happy Birthday Joshi, Stealth Virus
 Korea aka LBC Boot
 Microbes
 Murphy aka Murphy-1, V1277, Stealth Virus
 Ohio
 Ping Pong-B aka Bouncing Ball Boot
 Stoned aka Hawaii, Marijuana, New Zealand, San Diego, Smithsonian,
 Stoned II aka Donald Duck
 Sunday
 Yankee Doodle aka TP44VIR, Five O'clock Virus

	Would some kind soul please post/e-mail the address of a
reputable anonymous-ftp archive site which carries the latest
releases of the McAfee virus software?  I've heard that simtel20
(and mirrors, too then?) carry it, but, for the life of me, I couldn't
find anything.

	Any info will be greatly appreciated....

Subject: Checking during Desktop Rebuild (Mac)

John Costello asks about Virex's automatic checking when Norton
Utilities is rebuilding the Desktop. Virex (and SAM, and other
anti-WDEF programs) hook the OpenResFile trap and look for the
Desktop file being opened (which, obviously, it is when it is
being created). These programs can then look for "implied
loader" viruses before the application has a chance to make a
call that might wake them up - opening the Desktop adds the
Desktop to the top of the current resource search order, where
bogus,  viral executable resources could override the desired ones.

Hi. Your problem sounds like a DA which does not clean up properly
when closed, leaving a bad handle to a "menu" (now garbage) in the
menu list. It may be bad, incompatible with the current system, or
damaged.

I have also seen applications do this. If you can, try to get together
with your user and see if you can duplicate the error. You may also
want to check the level of system she is running (some very old
programs will fail spectacularly under new systems/ROMs, and some new
programs will do likewise under old systems). Reinstalling the System
and the DA's might also be useful.

Getting a first-hand look at the problem should be your first
priority. Also, if she uses other Macs, do they fail in the same
way? Might be a bad application or system disk. Do other disks
(formerly OK) start acting up after she has used them in her
machine? If so, it may be a virus.

Subject: Pascal Virus? Help!!! (PC)

I have discovered a probable virus on my clone.  Recently I obtained
McAfee's Scan66 and placed CRC codes on my executables and my boot
record and FAT.  Today, McAfee's scan67 said that the boot record and
boot sector had become corrupted, but did not name a virus.  I then
used scan without the /cv option and it found nothing.  Then I tried
scan with the /x option and it found nothing.  Could Norton's speed
disk utility or spinrite have altered the boot record and boot sector.

I had a similar problem a month ago.  My file slowly became
crosslinked, yet scan found nothing.  A segment of code approx. 912
bytes long became attached to all files with the .PAS extention.  When
I did a directory of my subdirectory with my pascal complier in it
(Purchased from my book store), it displayed my root directory.  Thus
I had an infinite number of directories.  I reformated my hard
drive(high level) and reinstalled my software.  Has anyone ever heard
of "Dr. Pascal"?  After reading Hoffmans virus list, I am thinking
maybe some version of Anti-Pascal? Or maybe a new version of 4096?  I
am pulling my hair out.  Let me know what you think?  Has anyone
suffered similar symptoms?

Thanks,  Paul Evans
