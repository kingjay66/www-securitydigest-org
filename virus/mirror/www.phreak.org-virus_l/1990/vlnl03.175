Subject: Apologies (Mac)

Since I've gotten several letters about it now, I'll simply make my
statement in public:

I apologize if anyone thought I provided too much detail in my
explanation of why the Desktop checking occurs when Norton Utilities
recreates the Desktop file. I didn't think I supplied any information
which anyone with a copy of Inside Macintosh and a little thinking
could not obtain on their own. I will try to be more circumspect about
such matters in the future.  However, I will try to be more
circumspect in the future.  (What a downer - first thing Monday
morning...)

Subject: Viruses and Novell's Netware

I would like to hear of Sys Administrators experiences w/ Viruses on
Novell Networks.  Our servers were infected w/ Jerusalem B several weeks
ago and I'm gathering as much info as I can.

Particuliarly interested in:

- -viruses ability to bypass SRO flags
- -other vulnerable Novell security "holes"
- -what about Execute only?  does it really protect?
- -are the FATs safe?
- -Is Write enough or does a virus also need Modify to bypass the SRO?

I've experimented w/ some of these and haven't arrived at any firm conclusions.
If requested, responses will be kept in strict confidence.

Mac WO/Men out there:

Have any of you had problems with Suitecase II lately? Or, after
loading in ATM 2.0?  At the Boston Computer Society Resource Center, a
selection of machines open to members to test out software, we have
been having a wierd intermittent problem.  In the last six weeks, we
have had three machines become wierd because something goes wrong with
Suitecase II (V 1.25, I believe).

I assume it is the usual problem, but the Director of the Ham Radio SIG also
had a problem. Any one else having Suitecase II crashes?

Symptoms: The machine will not boot unless Suitcase is pulled out of the
system folder. I meant to keep a copy of a corrupt one [then again, I may
have], but did scan the machine with Disinfectant 2.2 and found nothing.

One thing I did notice about ATM 2 was that it needed V 1.25 or better [1.26
is the latest? version of Suitcase II] to operate.

Well?

    Possibly not a virus (Mac)
With regards to the possible explanation about the "kitty cat virus" being
the result of a corrupted DA, check if the user has the DA Neko running.
Neko is a DA whose sole purpose is to display a cute kitten running around
after a mouse.  I  hope that is the answer.  We don't need any more
viruses.

Subject: Anyone recognize this virus? (PC)

        REcently I heard of a virus that was being spread around Oak Ridge, TN.
From what I understand, it completely erases your hard drive and then reformats
it (pretty nasty!).  Does anyone know anything about this particular virus
(ie what it is called, where it originated, etc), or is this a rather common
virus effect and hard to pinpoint which virus causes it?

                        Thank you.

Subject: The Virus in Society

Dear Virus-L readers,
     I am an anthropologist currently looking at social and cultural
issues possibly illuminated by the computer virus.  I am very
interested in personal experiences, stories, overheard conversations,
dreams, etc. that may show the social effects of the virus among
computer users of all types and levels of sophistication.
     I am particularly interested in any and all stories about loss of
data by any means, feelings about waiting on the computer, and most
especially for feelings regarding the virus and its relatives.  Have
you ever heard of people who thought they had a virus but didn't or
who panicked and did silly things because they thought they were
infected?  How did you react the first time you were infected?  Does
anyone else share hostile feelings toward virus creators such as those
expressed by Ross Greenberg in the Flushot documentation?  Or, was
that just hype to sell software?  Why do people create virues anyway?
Questions like that.
     Since this request is likely too weird and definitely irrelevant
for this list, please e-mail responses to me at

Subject: LAN File Servers & Viral Spreading

In Volume 3 Issue # 172, Michael Kessler writes:

If I understand the environment about which you are speaking, then I
do not think this is a reliable defense mechanism. The environment
sounds familiar because several of my clients have asked me similar
questions along this line: "Suppose I have several MS-DOS workstations
on a LAN. Suppose that the LAN includes one or more shared file systems
running on separate file server machines of dissimilar types, like
Novell, 3-COM, DECNET-DOS, etc. If MS-DOS workstation "A" is infected
by a virus, is it possible for it to infect files on these servers? Is
it further possible for that infection to spread to the other MS-DOS
workstations?...."

In most cases, the answer to the above question is YES, since each
workstation gets a "DOS-like" view of the shared file system. Infected
applications on MS-DOS workstations can probably access shared files as
if they were local files, and many viruses can spread by this means.
Even if the shared file system is administered by "foreign" hardware
such as a Mac or a VMS machine under DECNET-DOS, applications on the
local MS-DOS workstation still view the file system as if it were a
collection of local files which could be infected. Other workstations
accessing shared files that have been infected may well drag the
infection onto their local disks and subsequently infect other shared
files too...

It is interesting to note that programs on the servers that are native
to "foreign" (non MS-DOS) environments are probably safe from infection
by the typical MS-DOS based virus. In the above example, although it
would be easy to imagine severe infections of MS-DOS files made
available to a LAN from a VAX running DECNET-DOS, it would be very
unlikely for VMS itself, or any "native" VMS applications to be
infected without a specially targetted attack that was aware of the
configuration and exploited some bug in the server's architecture. For
the same reasons, viruses in VMS applications would be unlikely to
spread to MS-DOS files. If your server is a Mac, it is unlikely that
Mac viruses will spread to MS-DOS files, but MS-DOS viruses will be
generally unimpeded. In view of the general disregard of security
issues demonstrated by most LAN vendors so far, it will not be
surprising if viruses develop that can cross these server-operating
system boundaries by exploiting known bugs or by deceiving system
operators into granting executable control to decoy programs. But so
far, I have heard of no such thing.

Disinfectant 2.3
================

October 23, 1990

Disinfectant 2.3 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.3 detects the C strain of the MDEF virus. This new strain was
recently discovered in Ithaca, New York.

Version 2.3 detects a variant of the ANTI A virus which version 2.2 failed
to detect properly. There are no significant differences in behavior
between
the original ANTI A virus and this variant, and version 2.3 identifies both

of them as ANTI A.

There have been no changes to the Disinfectant sample source code since
version 2.2.

Disinfectant 2.3 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
acns.nwu.edu [129.105.49.1].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu,
comp.binaries.mac, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet,
America Online, Calvacom, AppleLink, and other popular sources
of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of free
and shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by sending a
self- addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy disk to the author
at the address given below. People outside the US may send an
international postal

reply coupon instead of US stamps (available from any post office).
Please use sturdy envelopes, preferably cardboard disk mailers.

The following is now available from the UNIX-SW archives as the file
PD2:<UNIX-C.INFO>SECURITY-DOC.TAR-Z.

- --Dave

A new white paper from SRI International's Information and Telecommunication
Sciences and Technology Division is now available.

The paper, "Improving the Security of Your UNIX System," describes measures
that you as a system administrator can take to make your UNIX system(s) more
secure.  Oriented primarily at SunOS 4.x, most of the information covered
applies equally well to any Berkeley UNIX system with or without NFS and/or
Yellow Pages (NIS).  Some of the information can also be applied to System
V, although this is not a primary focus of the paper.

An abbreviated Table of Contents:

        1. INTRODUCTION
                The Internet Worm, the Wily Hacker, other break-ins

                Trusted hosts, secure terminals, NFS, FTP, TFTP, mail,
                finger, modems and terminal servers, firewalls
           2.3 File System Security
                Setuid shell scripts, sticky bit on directories, setgid
                bit on directories, umask values, encrypting files,

        6. SUGGESTED READING
        7. CONCLUSIONS
        REFERENCES
        APPENDIX A - SECURITY CHECKLIST

In order to format the paper, the "troff" text formatter and the "-ms" macro
package (available with any Sun or Berkeley UNIX system) are required.  You
*do not* need a PostScript printer, unless you want to print the cover page
with the SRI logo on it.

The paper is available via anonymous FTP from the host SPAM.ITSTD.SRI.COM
(128.18.4.3) as the file "pub/security-doc.tar.Z".  Be sure to remember to
set "image" mode on the transfer.  Sorry, UUCP access is not available - if
you don't have Internet access, find a friend who does.

Enjoy.

All around my hard drive, directories with the names "DELETED" are

The second, perhaps related, perhaps not, does the following - it
erases file from my hard drive, and leaves only one character in the
file. (Hex e5)

If anyone has ever heard of theses, or knows of a de-viruser that

Subject: Disinfectant 2.3? (Mac)

   Having heard about Disinfectant 2.2 I set about getting a copy. No
sooner had I downloaded it I found out about Disinfectant 2.3. Wary of
new releases of virus software without the attendant flury of notices
on VIRUS-L and BBS's I checked it out on a floppy only system. It
appears to be genuine stating in the revision history that v2.3 does a
better job than v2.2 of detecting ANTI A and the C strain of MDEF.
Scans using v2.2 show it to be clean. It seems to walk, talk and act
the same as v2.2 including the Monty Pythonish About Disinfectant.

   Pardone my caution but there have been a few incidences of "new"
releases of utilities that were in reality nasties. We have found that
distributing contaminated software to users is realy bad for business.
Has anyone else heard of this new release?

detailed information about the reasonably new and the new viruses
currently circulating.

  I would also like from any one out there reading ,details to any new

importantly their effects on the system.

  At the present time i've obtained through various sources approx.
42 virus/trojan bootblocks + BGS9/TTV1 + IRQ viruses. However i known
nothing of the Revenge of the Lamer, and only a small amount of the
Xeno. Please can i have info on latter viruses so when i release my
detector it will be as up todate as humanly possible.

		Many thanks in advance

Subject: Re:Possible virus on Commodore

I really doubt that there is a virus on your friend's Commodore 64.
There just simply isn't any place for it to go, since it doesn't have
battery backup and doesn't load in any files from disk everytime it's
used.  However, I suppose it's possible for there to be a virus out
for the GEOS operating system on the 64, and probably remotely
possible that there is a virus that is designed for a specific
application, and he got the virus and useed the application in the
same session.  But since it was on two utilities, I'd guess it's a
hardware problem...

A related issue - Virus-L digest entries frequently refer to McAfee's
products, especially the SCAN products, for detecting viruses.  Much
less frequently, reference is made to one or two other detection
products.  Certainly there must be others out there, aren't there?

One other detection product I know of is "Dr. Panda Utilities"
programmed by Andy Hopkins that was sold with Pamela Kane's book,
V.I.R.U.S. et al.  I have not seen it mentioned in Virus-L Digest.
Can someone give me an evaluation?  Maybe this was published in
earlier digests - I've only recently subscribed - if so, would you
please republish?  If not, would appreciate any input.

As I said, I'm new to the digest and NOT a PC power-user.  I am
involved in computer security principally from a policy and procedures
standpoint.  The current virus threats forced me to learn as much as
possible.  This digest is an excellent vehicle for keeping current.  I
really appreciate all the good information.  It is also my role to
receive reports of contaminations and intrusions, and to refer victims
to computer technicians for problem resol- utions.  I need all the
help I can get.

Thanks in advance.  Andy.
