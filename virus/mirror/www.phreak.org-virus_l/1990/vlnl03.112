VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: George of the Jungle virus????? (Mac)

I work at a computer lab here on campus, and we had someone come in
and ask about this..  I may not ahve this totally correct...

WHAT IT DOES.....

1. It's a file in the system folder...

2. If you open it (it say's it's a word perfect document) it causes the
system to crash and gives message that says it can't open it, and that
it needs wordperfect to open it.  (Opposite order listed)

3. Comes and goes, not consistent.  First noticed it on Friday the 8th.

4. Not associated with anything purchased.

5. Seems to have quite a bit of activity.

6. Virus protection and disinfectant schemes don't seem to care that
it's around.


I know this is vague.  Please help me ask the person the correct
questions so I can help you out more.  Is there any kind of
standardized virus report form?

Thanks for your help.  We are currently trying to obtain a copy of
this thing.  Still not sure if it's a virus or not.

Thanks for your help...

Well, I'm not sure what I've got here, but may not be as serious as I
thought.  We have got a copy here at the lab.  It's has the
WordPerfect feather on a trashcan Icon.  I opened it on an isolated SE
by double-clicking on the trash/feather icon.  WordPerfect complains
that it can't open this kind of document.  On the isolated SE,
WordPerfect goes ahead and opens an untitled document.

Is this a standard WordPerfect Icon?  The person found this document
in his system folder.  I have a copy on floppy if anyone would care to
look at it.

I have seen a copy of FSP_17.ARC on wuarchive.wustl.edu.  The latest
version I was aware of was 1.6.  Ross having not been terribly active
on the list lately, does anyone know if this is legit?

Subject: SNEAK - a virus? (Mac)

Configuration:

Mac II and Mac IIcx connected over TOPS.

There were some problems with printing, saving, opening files etc.
Using Disinfectant 1.8 did not find any viri. Interferon 3.1
reported a SNEAK virus. Some time ago, somebody said this is not aa
virus.

What is it then?!!!

Any help appreciated.../Michael

This is true in the short term, but every virus has to start small, even
the biggest and most prolific.  A company looking far to its future -
ie. a couple of years, might stand to benifit from such a policy.

I'd hate to think that it would happen though - it's pretty morally
reprehensible.  It's like a drug company developing and releasing new
diseases, just to keep up the demand for new medicines.  On the other
hand, I don't think that it is too likely.  There are two reasons for
this:
(i) the dangers for the company are too great.  If any news of such
activity was leaked or discovered, it would be curtains in a big way.
Such security compromises are just too likely for the company to risk
it.
(ii) more impiortantly perhaps,  is that companies distributing virus
scanners are unlikely to need to resort to such tactics.  We don't seem
to have any lack of new viruses out there.  Hackers seem only too ready
to write, and worse yet, distribute viruses.  Until we educate such
criminals in responsible use of computers, virus scanners will be a
healthy business.

I don't know about the others, but the XMAS was a trojan horse worm, RTM was
a directly attacking worm, and the WANK worm was on VAX/VMS, not UNIX.

All of these, I believe, used network utilities and mail programs to infect
hosts.

Subject: What's the best pc clone virus protection pgm? (PC)

          Like to get some opinions on this one. If you could only get
one program for your pc/pc-xt/pc-at or clone, what would it be? This
is dicey, I know, what with viruses constantly evolving.
          Recently a lot of folks have been leaning towards McAffee's
SCAN program. Then there was one by a fellow, whose name escapes me
right now. He was offering a reward of a cache of free software to
whomever turned in a virus programmer, and helped get him/her arrested
and convicted.
          Anyway, appreciate a lot of opinions, and experiences, good or
bad. I think we may be getting up a site liscense deal, and so I need
some help towards getting the best for the buck.

Subject: The "Tiny" virus (PC)

Among the 10 (or so) new PC viruses which have appeared this month is
one which is by far the smallest one known - only 163 bytes.

It is very primitive - does not restore the original date/time of
infected files for example.  In fact, it does nothing but replicate.

The virus infects only .COM files, by adding itself to the end and
placing a 3-byte JMP at the beginning.  When an infected program is
run, the virus will search the current directory for a program to
infect.

"Tiny" seems to be based on the Kennedy virus, and was sent to me from
Denmark by the same person who sent me a sample of Kennedy.

I have had a quote attributed to me that was not mine.  I would
appreciate it greatly if people would get their facts straight before
posting messages.  And don't whine about your Mail program not working
right.  If it doesn't work, trash it!

The quote that was attributed to me was actually posted by Mike
Cummings.  The person who falsely paired me to this quote was Valdis
Kletnieks.

Now to reply to Valdis:

I agree with Mike!  This is a stupid thing to do!  What is the
point of having hardware protection if it is so easy to defeat!
Perhaps you are not familiar with the PS/2s.  Some of them can
have the case removed in under 15 seconds, and the wire could be
swapped in another 3.  Close the case in another 15.  Copy a diskette
in one minute.  Power the machine off.

There!!!  In less than two minutes in your office, I can steal
confidential files off your hard drive that you THOUGHT were protected
by hardware protection.  I can do that during the day while you walk
to the coffee pot and back.  If however, I had to disable your machine
for two hours to eliminate your password, it would be MUCH more obvious
that something was happening.
Or do you lock your door every time you leave your office?

Subject: - Virus's and Solutions

I have 2 questions about viruses please can some body answer??

q1. There is a virus which reduce speed of booting plus reduce
capacity of drive i.e you can't read high density diskette drive on it
will be only 360k.  What is the virus name and what is the solution???

q2. Virus lives in memory when you put system off you can't get rod
off it, It will go to clock ROM chip!! Is there any solution other
than disconnecting battery??

Thanks in advance

I just saw an IBM announcement a week or two ago which mentioned free
security enhancements for RSCS.  Several of these features looked
pretty useless, except for one which provides the file filter
mentioned above.  That seems like a useful hunk of code to help nip
things quickly.

Maybe I missed the little write up on Virus-L about the new Netscan but why
the new version? I looked in the documentation and it doesn't say anything
about the "B" version. Maybe the moderator can quickly clear this up for me?
Thanks.
