Subject: re: Help with Jerusalem virus (PC)

One of the bugs in the Jerusalem virus is that it will sometimes
overlay part of an EXE file when it infects.  Virus-removing programs
will not always be able to tell that this has occurred, and may tell
you that the program has been successfully disinfected.  There's not
much you can do about it if that's what's happened, except find a good
copy of the program somewhere else...  DC

Subject: New Virus - The Saddam Virus (PC) (INFO)

Here are specifications of the NEW virus 'The Saddam Virus' The virus
was found few days ago on a BBS in Israel and was probably written by
the one who wrote the original Stupid Virus.  The virus was found on a
file named SCAN.COM in a package named SCANV68.ZIP so please let
McAffee know about this virus so he wont release ver with this number
for the sake of the Israeli Users.  The virus isn't widespread (I
hope) It was download-able just for few days and then deleted by the
SysOp of the BBS, The virus also probably wasn't spred out of Israel.

BTW: Please skip over my english mistakes

Entry...............: The Saddam Virus
Alias(es)...........:   ---
Virus strain........: The Stupid Virus
Virus detected when.: 1-October-1989
              where.: BBS in Israel
Classifications.....: COM file infecting virus/extending, resident.
Length of virus.....: 917 - 924 bytes depends on the size of the name of
                              infected file.
- --------------------- Preconditions -----------------------------------
Operating system(s).: MS-DOS
Version/release.....: 2.0 or higher
Computer model(s)...: IBM PC,XT,AT and compatibles
- --------------------- Attributes --------------------------------------
Identification......: Memory: INT 6Bh points to original INT 21h.
                               (see Particularities [4])
                      .COM files: The encryped string.
                              to decrypt the string add 6 to each char,
                              the terminating char is 24h before adding 6.
                              The name of the infected file is stored
                              by the virus.
Type of infection...: System: The virus copies itself to high memory by the
                              following calculation:
                              [0:413]*40h-867h
                              The virus does not lower the ammount of memory
                              that is written in [0:413] nor making DOS think
                              the area is used so big programs will make the
                              system hang.
                      .COM files: Extends .COM files. Adds about 918 bytes to
                              the end of the file.
                      .EXE files: Not infected.
Infection trigger...: every call to INT 21h
Interrupts hooked...: 21h, 6Bh.
Damage..............: Prints the string:
                              HEY SADAM
                              LEAVE QUEIT BEFORE I COME
Damage trigger......: Counts the number of times INT 21H was requested
                              and on every eight time will print the string.
Particularities.....: 1. Many programs load themself to this area and
                         erase the virus from the memory.
                      2. The virus uses INT 6BH replacement for the original
                         INT 21H.
                      3. The virus infect just files in the current directory.
                      4. If the disk is write protected you'll see the message
                              from DOS about the write protection,
                              When the virus try to spread.
- --------------------- Agents ------------------------------------------
Countermeasures.....: F-Prot 1.13 RESIDENT PART ONLY:
                              identify the virus as The stupid Virus
                              and don't let the program to get on memory.

Subject: Request for info on Joshi (PC)

Here we are again ...

This morning, when i turned on an AT-class machine in our lab, the
screen suddenly blanked and an astonishing message appeared (in
40-column mode):
            "Type 'Happy Birthday Joshi'!"

I could only proceed after typing the stupid message.  After doing some
tests i found some interesting facts:
- - SCAN v62 didn't detect any virus
- - the system date was changed to January 5th, 1990
- - CHKDSK & PCShell showed that DOS reported only 634k of total memory
  (should be 640k)
- - cold and warm boots are much slower than before

I executed the manufacturer set-up program and corrected the date.
Now the message doesn't show up anymore, but the other symptoms are
still present.  I believe that the virus is hiding either in the hard
disk partition table or in the CMOS, since it's activated before the
operating system load.

Would anyone please send me information on how to deal with this
virus?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: mac virus(?) in school machines (Mac)

Recently I was delivering a course to new mac users at a school in
Swift Current (that's in Saskatchewan; in Canada - for those
collecting strange city names).  The school has 20 MAC+'s, with
Seagate20MB external drives.  All of the users are new to the mac -
several had never even turned on their machines yet.  I happened to
bring Disinfectant 2.1 (I have 2.2 now thanks) with me, so I checked
all of the hard disks. 7 of the 20 were infected with nVIR which was
(accolades to the author(s?) of disinfectant) easily repaired.

I post this since it shows how persuasive some viruses (viri?) can be;
the typical users at that site would have *NEVER* thought about
checking. (sigh)

Subject: Origin of mem-stat.sys file in my rootdir? (PC)

I recently discovered an unknown file in my root directory called
MEM-STAT.SYS. What disturbed me was that it had a System attribute,
and could not be copied or deleted until that was changed. I don't
remember putting it there or seeing it before, or any recent share-
ware that contained such a file. Viewing with browse revealed some
statements about chip speed, memory size. The file was 600+ bytes.

Does anyone recognize this file? Thanks in advance.

Subject: Detecting Stealth Virus (PC)

Here is a program that will detect stealth type viruses in memory. It
works on the 4096, and Fish-6. It should work on the Mother Fish
(Whale) also, since it uses the same method of redirecting the
interrupts. I wrote it for the shareware A86, but it should assemble
with MASM, TASM or WASM with minor modifications.

 ADD     [BX+SI],AL
 ADD     [BX+SI],AL
 ADD     [BX+SI],AL
 MOV AX,3521h
 INT 21h
 ES:
 CMP B[BX],0EAh
 JE FOUND
 MOV AH,9h
 LEA DX,NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE
 INT 21h
 INT 20h
 NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE:
 DB 'Stealth Virus not found in memory$'
 FOUND:
 MOV AH,9h
 LEA DX,FOUND_MESSAGE
 INT 21h
 INT 20h
 FOUND_MESSAGE:
 DB ' Stealth Virus active in memory $'

This program will not become infected by the 4096, although the Fish-6
and Mother Fish (Whale) will attack it easily (the 4096 thinks the
file is already infected).

Any comments and suggestions are appreciated. This program is free to
use by all private individual (others, please ask me first). I can be
reached on the Interlink and Fidonet virus conferences (as well as
Virus-L). My Bitnet address is MMCCUNE@SCTNVE. My next posting will
include a stealth virus remover...<MM>.

Subject: More (small) info about Saddam Virus (PC)

Hello,

recently I posted info about the Saddam Virus on virus-l first an info
that I collected from a message on BBS's net in Israel it was posted
from VIRUS-L at 4/10, After a day or two I posted another info file to
VirAlert this info file is info of my views, And now I'm sending
another small info I by mistake didnt placed in the info file.

The virus overwrites the first 3 bytes of the file and place there a
CALL command to his startup code.

  Call your local phone company.  I have 2 phone lines which  I have been
using with modems for 10 years.  Aug 30th, they both became un-usable
even though they worked fine as phones.  So I:
  tried 1200 instead of 2400 baud - ng
  tried a different serial port   - ng
  tried a different cpu board     - ng
  tried a different serial board  - ng
  tried a Hayes modem at 1200     - ng
  tried a different Hayes modem   - ng
  tried 300 baud                  - ng
    connected, but could not talk
  ran a line directly from my
    computer to the incoming
    terminal block                - ng
  tried calling a friend          - ng
    discovered that he could
    call me and I would answer,
    but he would get a 300 baud
    connection when I was at 1200.

  called the phone company
    "You haven't paid for line maintenance". They sent a guy out
    who tested my lines and said they had a problem outside somewhere
    that affected 50 lines.  He never came back.  A day later they
    called me,
    "You don't have an inside line maintenance agreement"  Finally, they
     replaced a couple miles of main cable and all was well.

  One week later, one line would not work at all, and the other only worked
    at 1200 baud.  So I called them again: "You don't have an inside line
    maintenance agreement".  Another guy came out and tested my lines and
    said the problem was outside.  He came back several hours later and
    said he couldn't even find my line.  Finally, I got to talk to someone
    who knew what a modem was: "We don't guarantee 2400 baud, just 1200".

  Two days later, they fixed it.  It seems that after they put in the
    new cable, they re-connected me to the old one so there was a mile
    and a half of antenna on my line.

  The moral is:  the phone company guarantees 1200 baud will work.  If
  it used to work and stopped all of a sudden, the phone company broke
  it.  If you persist, they will fix it, but you have to find someone
  there who has heard the word "modem" before.

Subject: Virus Software Advice

Hello,

I'm new to the PC world and very concerned about viruses.  The last
days I've downloaded tons (lots of megabytes) of anti-virus software
of all kinds. Now, who tells me which software itself is a trojan or
virus and which I may use as a good starting point.  Lots of the virus
tools were written my McAfee and look quite good.

I'd like to have some advice
- - which virus detection program is versatile enough to do the job
- - what is the best source to REMOVE viruses
- - how dangerous is it to install permanent anti-virus software and
- - what are their benefits against pure ASCII in/out and
  prechecking every binary before copying it to the system.

Please do not start a religious war about the quality of tools but
try to sort out old stuff. E-mail and I'll summary.

	Thanx in advance,
