VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: An interesting article (Gen'l)

I am told that in the November '89 issue of the American Mathematical
Monthly, to the effect that no completely safe computer virus test is
possible.  The proof is suppose to be short, and along the lines of
the various proofs of the Halting problem.

Subject: Shrink Wrap...still safe?

At a meeting yesterday some people made comments that some viruses
have been found in shrink-wrapped diskettes.  This did surprise me as
we have been using a rule of thumb to stick to shrink wrapped software
to help avoid viruses.  What comments &/or advice do you have for this
situation?
       Thanks, Craig

PS: I almost typed shrink warpped...interesting freudian slip!

As a Macintosh support person and programmer for the Computer Aided
Engineering Network at the University of Michigan, I think I should
try to clarify the response by U of M to the WDEF virus crisis.

The University of Michigan has two major computer support
organizations: the Computer Aided Engineering Network (CAEN) provides
support for the Engineering students and faculty, while the U of M
Computing Center (several organizations under the Information
Technology Division) provide computing support to the rest of the
University.

As one of the first sites in the country to be hard-hit by the WDEF
virus, we at CAEN acted immediately by searching out possible
solutions to the virus.  Virtually every CAEN lab mac was infected
(about 160 hard disks).  The virus was first disassembled by a member
of Mac Support, and another employee tailored one of the virus removal
patches (the one written by Juri Munkki (sp)) to meet our needs.  This
vaccine was then installed on all of the lab machines, and copies of
Disinfectant 1.5 were put on the lab software servers.  We then put
notices in the labs and an article in our newsletter.  All of this
action occured within 1 week of our discovery of the WDEF virus, and
we are now protected from it.

I can't speak for the Computing Center's public facilities sites, as
we are in a different unit of the university.  We did give them a copy
of our modified WDEF vaccine, but they chose not to use it, as far as
I know.

In other words, the entire University was not ignoring the problem, as
the previous poster implies.  We believe we now have the tools in
place to deal with new viruses which will inevitably infect our
Macintosh computers.

[Ed. This again raises an interesting point: how are other
Universities and organizations equipped to respond to and/or prevent
virus infections?  Anyone from groups with policies in place for these
things care to comment?]

     This is my first post to this or any group within this system.
     The information I have seen here has been very usefull and I
     look forward to keeping in touch with this group.

     I would like to know of a PUBLIC BBS in the US which has SCANNV55
     and CLEANV55 for download.  If anyone can help me, please let me
     know.  Thank you...

Subject: Harddisk destroying virus ?? (Atari ST)

A friend of my told me that there is a Virus lose that has a certain
effect on the harddisk attached to your atari st. It would have the
ability to make the drivehead of your harddisk make a 'headcrash'.
Has anyone had some experiences with this virus ????

Sounds like those machines need some Eradicat'Em.  All of the normal
Internet Mac Archive sites have it on-line by now.  If you can't get
it from there, or the MRC, gimme a yell (x6307 (if no answer try
x2335)), but it may take a few hours (maybe a day) for me to get it to
you.

Does anyone know of a combination Vaccine / Eradicat'Em init (ie,
catches everything) that doesn't need a lot of work to set up (ie,
like GateKeeper / GK Aid) ?

VIRUS ALERT:  IBM-compatible personal computers
The Vector:  THE DESKTOP FRACTAL DESIGN SYSTEM  (Michael F. Barnsley)

The Desktop Fractal Design System by Michael F. Barnsley, Iterated Systems,
Inc. (1989) is infected with a virus.  The program is sold through Academic
Press and is a companion program to Barnsley's textbook on fractals,
"Fractals Everywhere".  Academic Press is aware of the problem, and will
replace the distribution disk with a clean copy if you return it to them.

The virus does not seem to attach itself to the operating system, but
increases the length of every .EXE file run after an infected program
has been run.  The only .EXE file whose length does not increase is the
vector, SAT.EXE, the main program of The Desktop Fractal Design System.

Other symptoms include displacement of blocks of text on the screen
and total disruption of asynch communications.  I have also seen
"Stack overflow" errors in dBASE since I installed the infected
program.  I do not know if there are more serious delayed effects.

I assume that this was an accidental infection before the program
left Iterated Systems.  I don't know whether Academic Press is making
any effort to contact people who have purchased the program.
It's a great program, and probably a lot of people will pass copies
to their friends.  Watch out for it!
