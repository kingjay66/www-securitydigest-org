Subject: FluShot Plus 1.7 (PC)

I am using FluShot Plus 1.7 on my AT-compatible computer at home.  If
this is a reasonable question to ask in this newsletter, I would like
to know how to control how much memory it uses.

When it is started from my AUTOEXEC.BAT, it says that the size of the
protection table is 2048.  I have 14 programs defined with checksums
that it checks, as well as several rules to prevent unauthorized
writes, such as no writes of *.COM files without an interrupt.  If I
try to add a 15th program to the checksum list, FluShot Plus 1.7 HANGS
on startup.  If that happens, I have to reboot the PC from diskette
and take an entry out of FluShot's data file.  Obviously FluShot is
running out of memory and overwriting something.  Is there a way that
I can ask it to use more memory?  (I don't have that many other TSR's
and can spare another 2K.)  Where if anywhere are there specific
limits on what I can and can't do with FluShot?  Thank you.

Subject: Virucide & Twelve Tricks (PC)

Two correspondents in the past two months have commented that McAfee's
SCAN program detected the Twelve Tricks Trojan after the Virucide
commercial anti-viral program was installed.  There is an innocent but
technically sophisticated explanation.  Both SCAN and Virucide are
checking for the Twelve Tricks Trojan by looking for its signature.
SCAN looks at Virucide and sees the test for the signature of Twelve
Tricks and thinks that the test CONTAINS the signature of Twelve
Tricks.  This is a standard case of an odd interaction between
security programs.  There is probably no real problem.  However, I
would suggest a call to the vendor for Virucide to ask whether they
are in fact doing a signature check for the Twelve Tricks Trojan.

What is the Twelve Tricks Trojan anyway?

Subject: Re: Bitnet Worm spotted... (IBM VM/CMS)

I was unfortunate enough to execute this worm.  I still have a copy in
a very benign state so I can look at it.  I got it from someone in
Canada who inturn got it from someone in Turkey.  Fortunately I had
someone originally from Cyprus look at the program and try to decipher
some of the language in it.  It indeed is Turkish, and it says "This
EXEC shows the terminals in the terminal room and the library."  The
program seems to be copyrighted, since there is a message "(c) nihat
dinc id=oyo8904" in it.  oyo8904 is an ID which is consistent with the
UserID "structure" of TREARN.  My guess is that someone took a valid
program, hacked it to pieces, assembled/compiled it and sent it out.
Since the original language is Turkish, I also assume that the
original worm came from there.

Well, this is what my little piece of digging came up with.  Anyone
else have some evidence?

	I just received a copy of VIRUCIDE.EXE from one of our users
and he had found viruses in this file.  I ran SCAN67C on the diskette
and found two viruses in the VIRUCIDE.EXE file, TRICKS and KENNEDY
virus.  I ran CLEAN67 on the file and it didn't find any viruses.  Any
clues, help or advice?

[New MacVirus?] 'little kitty-cat faces' in menu bars, then reboots     172
[Re: New MacVirus? (Mac)] I've had similar with old games on 13" screen 174
the 'kitty-cat face' funny may be [Possibly not a virus (Mac)]          175

More likely the 'little kitty-cat faces'  are  merely  the  #172  message's
sender's  informant's  first  impression  of  that graphical character that
often  crops  up  among  binary  junk  that   viruses   and   miscellaneous
malfunctions  send to screen, the common smileface. To appear in menu bars,
they would have to be only one character high, which is not  likely  for  a
picture of a cat as guessed by the #175 message.

Subject: Re:Possible virus on Commodoore

In Digest V3 #177 someone mentioned that a virus could hide in the disk
drive since it has RAM, ROM, etc...  However, the RAM is cleared whenever
the unit is turned off.  Therefore, any virus would have to somehow store
itself in the drive whenever the computer is used, which can't be done.

However, as I mentioned before, someone running the GEOS operating system
could probably get a GEOS-specific virus...

Besides, considering the abundancy of Commodore hackers, I'd assume that if
a virus was possible, it would have been written by now...

Dear Telecommunicators,

I recently received a file called SCANV70.ZIP on The Library! BBS. This
file contains a trojan that is not detectable by the current version
of McAffees Scan program (SCANV67C.ZIP). This trojan will take out your
entire file system. I verified with McAffees bulletin board that the
most current scan was SCANV67C.ZIP. The next available release will not
be out until mid-november according to his board. I also, verified that
SCANV70.ZIP contained a trojan and that he is aware of it. Please
avoid using SCANV70 or passing it around as there is no defense for it.
The file was uploaded under a false logon. I've talked to the person
whose name it was uploaded in and he swears it wasn't him. (People,
please change your passwords and make them unique by bbs.)

Sincerely,

Kim Martin, The Library! BBS

Subject: Halloween virus? (PC)

	On November 1st, an interesting little virus (probably a
trojan) appeared on one of the PC's here at the University.  This one
seems to have a twist I haven't heard of before, although I have only
been reading Virus-L for a couple of months.
	I haven't messed with it myself, but apparently when you save
a file (for example, from an application) you get all of the signs
that the file was properly saved.  However, when you list the
directory, the file isn't there!
	We realize that this could be a problem that is not related to
a virus, but since we discovered the problem the day after Halloween,
we honestly feel this is a virus.  As of this posting, I don't know if
the virus has been removed, but we have several utilites to take care
of it (we hope).
	If anyone has any info or other occurrences of such a thing,
it can be mailed to me or posted to this group.

Subject: Passwords

Kim Martin's posting brings up a point that cannot be stressed too
highly: BBS SYSOPs can read passwords on their board. While it is a
pain to some extent to try to keep track of tens of systems/passwords,
it can be reduced to an algoritm that has the advantage of not being
vulnerable to dictionary searches.

Without being overly specific, I use a four part password, one of
which identifies if the system is internal, external commercial, or
external BBS; another is a personal identifier for this cycle; and a
third being an identifier for a specific location. This makes
passwords easy for me to construct mentally (at most, just the
location part needs to be recorded), and relatively secure so long as
location patterns are avoided.

Of course, for real security, dynamic one-time passwords using tokens
are the answer.

Subject: Trojans / Worms (IBM VM/CMS)

     A program named TERM MODULE was just identified in this magazine
as being a "worm" being distributed to VM sites on the Bitnet.  I have
two comments.  First, it appears that the malicious aspect to TERM is
identical to the malicious aspect to the infamous CHRISTMA EXEC.  In
each case the program uses a NAMES list to disseminate copies of
itself to multiple users on the same or other nodes after it is
invoked by an unsuspecting user.  Based on the description of TERM, I
would assume that it is a copy-cat based on CHRISTMA.

     Second, TERM MODULE and CHRISTMA EXEC belong to a previously
unidentified subspecies of malicious programs, which are hybrids
between Trojan horses as usually defined and worms as usually defined.
Like Trojan horses, they must be invoked by an unsuspecting user to be
activated.  Like worms, they propogate copies of themselves via a
network, and cause damage by clogging the network (in these cases, the
VM spool) with multiple copies of themselves.  One could consider
either of them to be a Trojan horse which contains a worm as its
payload and whose malicious agenda is the release of the worm.

     Stand-alone worms, such as the Morris Internet worm, rely on
vulnerabilities in the network to propogate themselves, such as by
subverting a network server or network daemon.  Trojan worms rely on
invocation by an unsuspecting user.  They are more dangerous than
conventional Trojan horses because they disseminate themselves without
secondary human action.  They are less dangerous than stand-alone
worms because they require primary human action for activation.

Subject: CURSE.EXE Trojan ? ? ? (PC)

There has been a lot of discussion on comp.windows.ms about the
possibility of CURSE.EXE actually being an IBM trojan.  A while back I
saw an article in this newsgroup about CURSE.EXE destroying the FAT
table "after some amount of time" (?).

It seems quite a few people are having problems with CURSE. . . has
anyone actually determined if it is a trojan??  Is it just a poorly
written program??  When the program is run, this disk it is run from
seems to get a lot of "unmovable blocks" and lost file errors (when
looked at w/Norton 5.0).

cica.cica.indiana.edu has removed Curse from its archives. . .  but I
have a feeling many people downloaded it before it was removed.  Does
anyone know anything about this??

Thanks,

Yes. I hope you'll consider "SafeWord VIRUS-Safe" from my company. It
is an extension to MS-DOS that automatically and transparently
examines all your programs as they are loaded for execution. It
quickly calculates a non-forgeable signature for each program being
executed and compares that signature with records from prior
executions. If anything has changed since the last time it was run,
the user is alerted. Otherwise, execution continues without any
disruption. It detects the spread of all known MS-DOS viruses, and is
believed to be capable of detecting the spread of all unknown viruses
when installed and operated according to our recommendations. The
signatures it calculates are consistent with ANSI and ISO standards.
This is commercial software, not shareware. The product design is
optimized for very large installations where hundreds or thousands of
PCs must be protected by a few specialists. Since virus-specific tools
like those from McAfee and Skulasen require updating every week or so
in order to be truly expert at removal, they may not be practical as a
first line of defense in large organizations. Our product is intended
as a companion to these other products in large organizations, so the
"rank and file" can be alerted to suspicious file changes. Our product
maintains detailed audit trails to help the experts do their jobs
after suspicious behavior is detected. It's a good match.
