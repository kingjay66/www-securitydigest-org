Subject: Obtaining McAfee programs (PC)

Folks,

John McAfee, et.al. has released the latest version of their anti-virus
programs. The release numbers are Scanv71, Cleanp71, & Vshld71. I
believe the release date was 01-Dec-1990.

For those of you that are concerned about getting ONLY McAfee's programs
- -- the number to his BBS is --> 408 988-4004  -- there are eight 2400
baud lines.

I will also be happy to send the files across the net, but that may
asking too much from the network.... :)

**ARE YOU SURE??** If so then you must have a new variant of STONED,
and it's a miracle that your virus scanners find it because most of
them *ONLY* look in the boot sector for STONED, because **STONED IS A
__BOOT SECTOR__ INFECTOR**.  (I seriously doubt that the code
fragment/s the scanners search for would remain unchanged in such a
mutant, but it is possible.)

Attempting to boot off **ANY** Stoned-infected disk will install STONED.  The
infected disk **DOES __NOT__** have to be a system disk.

REPEAT:
Attempting to boot off **ANY** Stoned-infected disk will install STONED.

In answer to Patrick's question re spreading from HD to floppy:

When executed (at bootup), STONED reserves 2K at top of memeory, takes
over the BIOS interrupt 13H vector, checks if clock ticks mod 8 is
zero (and if booting from floppy?) and outputs "Your PC is now
Stoned!" if so, checks for hard disk to infect (if booting from
floppy), then loads and executes the original master boot record
(which it hid somewhere relatively safe when the disk was first
infected.)  (At this point bootup will fail if you have an infected
non-system disk in A:, but the virus will remain active if you insert
a system disk in A: or open the drive door and allow bootup to proceed
from your HD.)  Any subsequent calls to INT 13H, requesting READ or
WRITE functions, result in the viral code being activated first.  The
virus then checks the disk in A: for a STONED infection, if a
non-infected disk is found the virus infects that disk, then returns
control to the original INT 13H code.  This means that doing a DIR on
a clean floppy in an infected machine will result in the disk being
infected.

The important thing about STONED (and probably most other boot sector
infectors) is that re/booting with *ANY* infected disk in A: (doing
the three fingered salute while you have a data disk in A: - who
hasn't done this??)  will result in the virus going resident.  If you
have a non-infected HD it will normally be infected at this point.
When people say they booted off a clean HD, but now have a virus, if
it is a boot sector infector you can bet your life savings that they
had a floppy in A: with the door closed.  What they mean is that the
system *loaded* off the HD - they *booted* off A:.

Now for some speculation: It is conceivable that a trojan could be
written to spread the STONED (or any other) virus.  At execution,
apart from doing whatever the prog was supposed to do, it would have
to do what the virus it harboured does when infecting/installing
itself.  I have neither seen nor heard of such a beast, but it is
possible that executables could spread virii that *by themselves* only
spread through boot sector mechanisms.

Readers who aren't already aware may be interested to know that Jim
Baltaxe was one of the people at Victoria University involved in
diagnosing and identifying the STONED virus.

Subject: LZEXE - a possible anti virus application (PC)

I use a program on my hard drive called LZEXE. It is a shareware
program from France, used to compress EXE files so that they take up
less disk space. It often achieves approximately 50% savings, and
still allows you to run the program. It decompresses the file directly
into memory at an astounding speed. If you have a 286 or better, you
probably wouldn't even notice the loss of time. The really neat part,
though, is that it includes a self-check into every file compressed
with the utility, so that if the file has been changed it will notify
you. This would detect the presence of a virus in the software.

	The program is easy to use, and can also compress COM programs
if they are converted to EXE's. I would be willing to file transfer it
to anyone who wants it directly from my PC. I've been using it for
about 6 months now without problem, and it passes the latest SCAN I
have, so I think it's safe to assume it's clean. Anyway, if you want
to file transfer it from me, send me E-mail at my above listed address
and we can make arrangements. I support most standard transfer
protocols.

Subject: Help! Anybody here of this virus? (PC)

We've discovered what looks like a virus on our DOS PC's, and would like
any feedback from anybody familiar with the following symptoms:

1. io.sys size increased by 66 bytes;
2. io errors create four files that loop endlessly,
   i.e. a.bat to b.bat to c.bat to d.bat to a.bat;
3. non-movable blocks inserted on the hard drive: is this a worm?

Please respond by email.

Subject: AntiVirus Plus (PC)

I received AntiVirus Plus today for review, and find that the related
files INST.EXE, PRE_INST.EXE and PREVENT1.EXE are all considered (by
F-PROT) to be infected with the 4096 virus.  SCAN gives no alarms.  I
assume, pending further tests, that Techmar is using the same search
string that frisk is.

	Well I forgot a few things.
1).  PKZIP with -AV option is only available in the USA so only people
     with the USA version could ZIP files with this option.  I don't know
     if PKUNZIP (overseas) can handle ZIP files that have the AV on.

2).  The PKZIP that the VIRUS SCANNER author uses would be registered
     to him/her with his/her name and a unique Serial #.
     So even if someone unzipped the file and rezipped it with -AV
     option the name & serial number would be different.  So you
     could tell if the zip file was tampered with even if it
     was without malicous intent.

PS.  The PKZIP -AV option is only available to REGISTERED USERS.

Subject: University Policy

If you are part of a university site (as mine is),  I have a question or two
about your virus policy.

- - In the broadest sense,  what _is_ your policy?  Is it written down as a
  statement by your computer center?  (If so,  would it be possible to obtain
  a copy?)

- - If you use scanners/disinfectors,  do you distribute them or do you only use
  them yourselves in response to a call from a user?

- - If you do distribute scanners/disinfectors,  what sort of support do you give
  for the packages?  (Documentation,  training,  etc.)

- - How do you respond to calls from users?  Personal visits (for things like
  networks or hard drives),  have them come by in person (like for a diskette)?

- - Do you have penalties for users caught knowingly spreading a virus?

- - What packages do you use/recommend?  Are they commercial or
  shareware/public_domain?  (We're on a budget here;  guess which kind we're
  likely to use...)  Which have worked the best?

- - Anything you'd like to add.

Thank you for your time!  If you respond to the list,  please cc: me so that
I won't have to wait for the digest.

Subject: PKZIP Auto-Verification feature.. (PC)

There seems to be a common misconception floating around that just anybody
can use the auto-verification feature of PkZip.

This just isn't so!

In the documentation that comes with PkZip, it states that you have to get
in touch with Phil Katz, and give him some information about your company's
name; he will then send you a corresponding verification key that you
apply to the programs you are pkzipping..  This key is kept private, so in
effect, the whole system is a public-key cryptography system.

Someone mentioned earlier that a trojan version of PkZip was released by
someone.  This trojan version reported that the auto-verification key was
correct, and the software was intact.  There are two ways this could have
happened:
   1) The correct verification key was discovered, allowing any zip file
      to be stamped with Phil Katz's own signature, in which case, I'd be
      worried about the security, or...
   2) The self-extracting archive was modified to ignore the signature, and
      report "All's well!".
The second method can be tested by using PkZip 1.1 to test the signature,
instead of 'PkZip 1.2' (the trojan version).

Does anybody know the workings of the AV system, or more importantly, how
big the signature is, and whether two different signatures produce the same
result?

And as an aside, does anybody know how secure the PkZip encryption method is;
since the US Government insisted on the encrypting version of PkZip staying
within the boundaries of the US, one would suspect that it is pretty good.

They may have a feed.  Even if they don't, not every company or
organization that uses pcs/macs will have a feed.  Besides, reading
the list isn't the same as filling out a report to the police...
Consider also many do not report such things (for one reason or
another - such as not knowing who to report it to) and if nothing else
this will elicit the scope of infections.

Sounds like first they'd want to gather statistics to see how much of
problem it is before justifying more people and resources.

P.S. Do they get to wear neat uniforms?

Subject: Need info on McAffee AVS (PC)

Hello fellow netters:

I am a student consultant in the Micro support division of Information
Services at MIT. After doing an anti-viral software (AVS) evaluation, we
decided that McAffee was the best. We were able to get a price deal if
our computer store purchases in groups of 100.

Unfortunately, the store does not think anyone will buy that many
packages. They wanted to buy in groups of 25. The McAffee rep wouldn't
go that low (I don't blame him), so the computer store wants to buy from
the second choice (ViSpy) because they'll sell in groups of 25.

I think that McAffee's product is by far superior to anything else that
we have evaluated. I also think that there are a lot of people out there
that like McAffee as well as myself. This is where you people might be
able to help me!

If you like McAffee (or even if you don't) please send me email
(mlbarrow@eagle.mit.edu) telling me why you like or dislike McAffee's
package. If you dislike McAffee, please tell me which package you're
using and why you selected this package. I am willing to compile all the
responses and make them available to those that want 'em.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation & happy hunting!
