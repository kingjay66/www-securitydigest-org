VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: AIDS Virus (Mac) and AIDS Trojan (Non-Mac)

There is a Mac virus named AIDS. It's an nVIR-b clone (i.e., the
resources and code were modified to use resources of that name instead
of "nVIR").  It does the same stuff that nVIR does - i.e., reproduce
and sometimes beep when a program is launched. It does nothing
connected with the disease.

The non-Mac "AIDS Disk" being talked about lately is NOT connected
with the Mac at all. It was a program that purported to be a survey
which would tell you how much of a risk you had of contracting the
(non-computer) virus. It instead encrypted all of your files and
attempted to get you to mail $300-and-some to an address in Panama.

Clear?

No, in order to register a copyright you must be the author of the work,
or have the rights explicitly assigned to you by the author.
(I wouldn't consider an organization reliable if they WERE the authors,
would you?)

I suspect that there is no good legal solution for the virus problem.
People who create viruses don't expect to get caught, and probably
wouldn't be deterred by the threat of legal sanctions.  Also, it would
be an immense problem to prove who first released a virus in most (if
not all) cases.  For example, the Internet worm case was not quite
open-and-shut, despite the following unusual facts:
   1. The defendant admitted under oath that he did it
   2. There was a law which explicitly forbade what he did
          (i.e. unauthorized access to government computers with damage)

I would venture to guess that there are very few known virus authors out
there, even for the oldest, most widespread varieties.  The Brain virus
seems to be the exception, but even in that case it would be a nightmare
to try to prosecute the perpetrators.

Take a binary file editor. Or an interactive assembler. Or uudecode
reading from stdin. Any of these programs will take input from the
user and based on this input can reach most of the possible states of
the system, including those in which replication of the program can
occur. (I'm using "almost" in a loose sense: 2^990,000 is almost
2^1,000,000). So are these viruses? By your rationale they are. Or a
terminal emulator which based on input from the outside world could
cause infection (it could download an infected program from a bulletin
board). And what about a worm program that transmits itself to another
machine but does not infect other programs on the current machine?

Having said that, your method would be OK for most software, if you
only want to check for viruses not worms.

Subject: Mac Virus Harmlessness

It's interesting, but up until now, most viruses on the Mac have been
"damageless" - the only reason the cause trouble is because of bugs
and incompatabilities, not deliberately harmful code. nVIR, at worst,
causes your Mac to beep in some cases (side effects are worse -
crashes, hangs, printing failures).

Perhaps we just haven't had the right (wrong?) people writing Mac
viruses so far. Any ideas?

Eradicate'em and Gatekeeper Aid both stop the virus and automatically
remove it from the disk as disks are inserted.

Close enough; the default window definition procedure also has to be
invoked, and you have to be running under the Finder.

It might not be a problem on current Macs or current versions of the
System, but would be very likely to fail in future incarnations.
Also, available anti-virals probably wouldn't be able to tell the
difference between your "WDEF C" and a real infection, so well-meaning
disinfectors would wipe out your "inoculation". Finally, I think we
all agree that viruses to fight viruses simply help to continue the
upward spiral of virus technology, and that *any* virus has the
potential to cause damage under some circumstances. Worse, a virus
writer could take your supposedly harmless virus and hack it into a
virulent one. If your anti-virus virus contains your name, you might
have trouble convincing people (including law enforcement) that you
didn't write the nasy variant.

Jason, if no one there has the programs I mentioned above, they are
available from our LISTSERV. Worst case, there is a very simple way
of getting rid of WDEF infections, and it's BUILT IN to the Mac!

When you insert a disk, hold down the Command and Option keys. You'll
get a message asking if you want to rebuild the Desktop file. Click "OK".
This will blow away any existing WDEF infection. The same can be done
for boot disks: just hold down those two keys after the "Welcome to
Macintosh" screen appears. You'll get the same dialog, to which you
respond in the same way. Nothing could be simpler. Rebuilding the
Desktop causes it to be thrown away, virus and all, and a new copy
built. Since WDEF doesn't live anywhere else, you're all set.

At the time the message was posted, that was true. John Norstad created
1.6 since then, so versions of that program from sumex, John's node, or
the SCFVM LISTSERV are true, valid copies of Disinfectant 1.6.

WDEF resources are "window definition procedure" resources. They define
how windows look and act. They are legal.

>How about the program called WDEF uploaded in comp.binaries.mac?

It's an alternate window definition procedure and is OK.

>In fact, I've found some WDEF resource code in system version 6.0.3.

That's the code that defines the standard Mac window (scroll bars,
go-away box, zoom box, etc). DON'T DELETE IT or your System file will
no longer be usable.

Whew.

I'm posting this request on behalf of a friend who doesn't have access
to news.  Also, I don't always read this newsgroup, so please mail any
replies direct to me. If there is sufficient response, I will
summarise to the net.

The subject line says it all really...does anyone know anything about
the so- called "SYSLOCK" virus, and in particular, how it works, how
to get rid of it?  It has been discovered on "Compaq 286 & 386's and
PS2/30 + 20Mb HD". All my friend knows about it is that it appears to
add ~3500 bytes to files and spreads quickly!

Any help anyone could give would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

John

Subject: Other progs identify trojans? (Mac)

To the best of my knowledge, only SAM and the VD string I specified
will identify these two trojans at the present time. I would assume
that the anti-viral software developers will be updating their
products fairly quickly, and would expect to see announcements fairly
quickly though.

One point I would like to re-iterate, as several people have contacted
me about it and I may not have been very clear in my original posting:
Neither the "Mosaic" nor the "FontFinder" trojans are viruses. Neither
has the ability to reproduce or self-propigate. The only way that
either of these applications can be duplicated is by a user copying
the file, or by up/down-loading the files to/from a BBS...

Subject: copyrighting virus code

M.J. Crepin-LeBlond <ZDEE699@ELM.CC.KCL.AC.UK> suggests that all you
have to do to make having virus code illegal (except for the
privileged few who obtain permission) is to copyright it.  I'm no
lawyer, but it was my impression that once something has been released
in some form (uncopyrighted) to the general public, it could then
never be copyrighted.  Even if you could copyright viral code, it's
not likely to discourage the kind of people who write viruses (aren't
those the ones you are really after?) from copying it.  Also, what
happens if some virus-loving person copyrights it before you do and
then grants universal privilege to copy?  Just wondering...

Subject: More about 847 (PC)

The "Bulgarian" 847 virus is closely related to the Amstrad virus.
They are not identical, however. The text is different, and some minor
changes have been made to the code.

It is however so similar that existing virus scanners can detect any
program infected with "847" (PIXEL), "345" or "299".

More on the new Mac Trojans:

In response to Peter Johnston's message about the Trojans Mosaic and
FontFinder, I'd like to add a few things:

The Trojans hang (whether or not SAM denied the write attempt) due to
a bug in the code. When the bug is 'fixed', Mosaic goes on to give
further information to the user about what it has done.

As Peter mentioned, disks ARE undamaged if the Trojans' write attempt
is denied in SAM. All versions of SAM will alert you to this write
attempt with the message 'There is an attempt to bypass the file
system'. HOWEVER, this alert will only be given to the user if SAM is
configured in ADVANCED level.

Again, the best protection, as always, is to be sure your files are
backed up!
