VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Basically, "stealth" viruses go resident in memory and trap the
interrupts used by DOS. Then, whenever a file is requested, the virus
checks to see if the file is infected. If so, the virus code is
stripped off and the original file is presented. Nothing magic is done
to defeat checksums. Of course, the fact that the virus goes resident
is detectable, usually just by recording the CHKDSK memory return.

- --------------------------
In issue 184 and in a VALERT-L posting I wrote concerning the DataLock/920
PC virus:

>Each time an .EXE file is executed, it
>will increase in size by 920 bytes. The virus will only infect a file
>once but will infect any .EXE executed.

I must apologise for the poor English. This virus will only infect an
.EXE ONCE (an algorithm is used to place a signature in the file
header) adding 920 bytes to the file. No "stealth" mechanisms are
used.

McAfee's CLEAN will work or you can copy the original partition table
on a hard disk back to sector 1 (I believe it is stored in sector 7)
using DEBUG. On a floppy, simple replacement of the boot sector will
render the virus harmless though some data/executables may be
corrupted. (how fast can you press two keys and change floppies ?)

The SUNDAY virus is a JERUSALEM derivative that goes resident as a
20xx byte un-nammed TSR. On Sundays the virus will print a message and
delete (undeletable with several utilities) programs executed. A
mistake in the code in one varient keeps it from ever triggering but
all infect both .COM (once) and .EXE (each time run) programs.

I recently became a new computer owner, and since I trade disks
between colleagues frequently, would like to employ virus protection
or some scanning mechanism.  I've looked at the Frequently Asked
Questions equivalent, and found the ftp sites just fine.

My question:  what do each of the programs do?  Is there a program
that's considered the best, at least as of today?

Subject: Response to WDEF A problems (Mac)

Both Willem van der Wal and Kevin Hill wrote saying that they are
experiencing problems saving files to their hard disks. While Kevin
did not mention WDEF A (Kevin, have you found the same thing?) Willem
did, however WDEF A may not be causing Willem's problem.

Here at my university, we have been experienceing a rash of WDEF A
infections over the past year. I found some information that stated
this type of virus *usually* only affects the Mac IIci windowing
system, though I do believe that it "gets in the way" of normal
activity on other machines. You can get rid of virus by rebuilding the
Desktop on your hard disk (which is where it resides).

If you find that WDEF A is the problem, please let me know since it is
a recurring thorn in my side. Hope this helps.

P.S. To rebuild the desktop, hold down the command-shift-option keys on bootup

   In a recent msg, someone said that a "stealth" virus could evade
   checksum and CRC checks.  Can anyone tell me how this is done?
   Wouldn't the author of the virus have to know the checksum/CRC
   technique being used in detail?  Without specific knowledge of the
   polynomial being used, what could the virus author do?

Checksums are easy to beat.  CRCs are more difficult.  The combination
of both is unbeatable except by "stealth" techniques.  As I understand
it, the stealth type programs take over DOS or BIOS and if the
infected files or sectors or directory info about these is read then a
"fixed" version is actually returned.  The fixed version makes it
appear that the program or disk is uninfected.

   I can imagine that certain values wouldn't contribute to the checksum,
   but if you make the original size of the file part of the check, then
   adding those special values will change the file size, and render it
   detectable.

Yes, the way to add code without changing the checksum or without
calculating it from the entire file is to make the checksum of the
additions be zero.  Any addition would add to the file size.

   In short, it seems that if I am willing to give up the detection of
   virus propagation in real-time, I should be able to detect viruses ALL
   THE TIME (of course, if and only if I have a confirmed clean system to
   begin with).

   what am I missing?

The stealth concept.  That is why it is called stealth...  Your
detector would have to do all its disk I/O by itself, or somehow
guarantee that the BIOS and DOS routines have not been compromised.
And direct hardware I/O may not be completely safe on a 386 without
checking the MMU, which again may not be guaranteed safe.

Subject: Have you seen this one? (PC)

We have someone at NCAR that found an infected WprdPerfect file that
had been created on good friday.  On printing the file, the second
page comes up with "Happy Easter" and sometimes more stuff about
Christ and Easter.  The file is protected and attempts to delete or
copy it create more protected files.

The PC is one used by students from time to time, so that is likely
how it got the bug.  I can't file any information on this one.  Any
help out there?

Subject: DOS-TREND front cover magazine

Second message on the DOS-TREND magazine.

I now received several copies of the magazine!  we have two groups of
people claiming there is a virus or trojan on the disks!

1. the "AIDS-TROJAN" This is certainly a false alarm these people used
an older version of TNT-SCAN (Carmel) that had an ambigous search
string. In fact it probably searched for the instrinsic part of
MS-BASIC 3 compiled code. Thus it claimed that any file created by
that BASIC is an AIDS-TROJAN

2.Some people claim there is STONED II on the disk. We couldn't find
any infection on our samples! I am waiting for mail to arrive from
people who had an infection on their disks.

Since the disks are write enabled it is hard to say who put the virus
on the disks. At the moment I can't say if it is just a coincidence
that several people infected their disks with the *same* virus or if a
certain ammount of the production load was infected.

The publisher claims that their machines are clean!

I'll publish more when we are done with the search but then in VIRUS-L
not on VALERT-L

If SCAN doesn't detect any viruses on your C: drive, and as long as
you didn't boot up from the infected floppy, then your C: drive is
probably clean.  Like all boot sector viruses, the ONLY way Stoned
can infect a hard disk is to boot up from an infected floppy disk.
Even if the infected floppy is not bootable (not a system disk),
simply having it in the A: drive and rebooting or turning on the
computer is sufficient to infect the hard disk.

>   2) Is it safe just to copy the files to a new (clean) disk ?

Yes.  Stoned is strictly a boot sector virus; files are not
infected.  Just make sure that the virus is not present in memory
on the machine you do the copying (boot up from a clean, write-
protected DOS disk), and SCAN the target disk when finished just to
be safe.

>   3) If 1) and 2) have negative answers - what should I do ?????

If, perchance, SCAN or some other virus-scanning software DOES
detect an infection on your hard disk, the easiest solution is to
obtain either F-PROT (Fridrik Skulason, Box 7180, IS-127 Reykjavik,
Iceland, frisk@rhi.hi.is) or CLEAN (McAfee - same place you got
SCAN).  I believe the latest version of F-PROT (1.13) is available
through anonymous ftp from chyde.uwasa.fi or from
comp.binaries.ibm.pc; as for CLEAN, try the Home Base BBS at (408)-
988-4004, or ftp from mibsrv.mib.eng.ua.edu.

Subject: Mail/Defuze

a) To those who have sent me E-Mail without reply, there are two
   possibilities: 1) my "baroque" (as Ken puts it) server/address lost
                     the mail (I get about 2/3rds of what is sent)
                  2) the same system could not decode the return
                     address & I could not figure out an alternative
                     route (not being very experienced in Internet)
   In any event I do try to answer all mail received but can make no
   guarentees.

b) There seems to be a bit of hysteria builing about magical qualities
   of viruses. T'aint so ! On a PC at least, ALL viruses (and trojans,
   worms, etc) must execute to infect a system. Some have rather convoluted
   means of doing so but must execute FIRST in order to activate. The
   user is part of this process since a PC will not execute anything new
   unless told to do so. Incidently, the MAC is no different, only when a
   floppy is inserted, the O/S immediately looks for a DESKTOP file on the
   floppy and executes it.

   The CMOS RAM (clock, etc) cannot be executed. PERIOD. It might act as
   a storage facility for malicious software that knows where it is, but
   code executing from DOS memory addressable by the IP must have stored
   such information and is necessary to retrive it. DOS currently won't.

   Boot sector infectors (Stoned, Brain, Joshi, etc) are executable code
   that is stored in an area executed during the boot process. Without
   initiating a boot, you can leave the floppy in the drive forever and
   not become infected. COPYing or XCOPYing files from an infected disk
   will not infect a machine however DISKCOPY can pass the infection to
   a new disk. To infect a machine, the infected disk must be in the
   drive when a boot (warm or cold) is initiated.

   "Stealth" viruses simply trap interrupts (usually 21h) when they go
   resident and remove the virus code when an application requests an
   infected file so that a validator just "sees" the original file, but
   they must be resident in memory to work. Most go after COMMAND.COM
   first since the transient portion is usually loaded right after a
   upper memory virus goes resident. Good validation programs will flag
   this on the next load, but if the user says to "go ahead anyway", all
   bets are off. Every one of these that I have seen is easily detectable
   in memory just with what comes with DOS. The WHALE may have 30 different
   encyption algorithms, but all take memory from DOS.

   One of the biggest myths about nearly every virus is the "survives
   warm boots (ctrl-alt-del)". Yes, some do, but the few I am aware of
   all become resident in one area at the top of memory, change the
   Int 12h return (280h for a 640k machine), and trap the "warm boot"
   mechanism. Neither the common varieties of the Jerusalem nor the Stoned
   do this, however, to be safe, NOTHING survives a cold boot from a
   clean, protected floppy.

   Finally, for those just starting with Virus-L, I would suggest the
   following reading: Advanced MS-DOS by Ray Duncan, Microsoft Press;
   The 8086 Family User's Guide from Intel (later versions are also good);
   System BIOS for IBM PC/XT/AT Computers and Compatables from Phoenix
   Technologies Ltd, Addison-Wesley; Assembly Language Programming for the
   IBM PC AT, Brady; the Winn Rosch Hardware Bible by Winn Rosch, Brady;
   and THEN the Virus Information Summary List by Patricia Hoffman,
   available electronically.

   As a final exam, write a functional floppy boot record using LODSB,
   Int 10h (fn 0Eh), and Int 16h. For extra credit, use Int 12h and XLAT
   to report system memory at boot & validate your boot record. HINT: in
   the boot record, PUSH CS - POP DS won't work as you expect.

     Just a reminder that the Stoned virus is a boot sector invader
     and executes only when a machine is booted from an infected disk.
     Simply running _any_ program whether FTP'd or not will not result
     in activating this virus. Therefore, there must have been another
     route of infection (vector?). For beginners (aren't we all...)
     tell people never to leave a disk in a drive when you turn a
     machine either on or off. On is obvious - to avoid executing a
     boot sector virus (this can happen even if the diskette is not
     a system disk). Off is included simply to prevent people from
     forgetting to take it out before they turn the machine on again.

     Most of the major anti-virals will find and remove the stoned virus
     but if you want a specific for the Stoned virus, try using our
     NOSTONE.EXE which is available for anonymous FTP from several
     sites including our own, rata.vuw.ac.nz. Get /pub/nostone.exe.

Subject: Stoned in C (PC)

Thanks to all who responded to my previous questions on the Stoned
virus.  I used MDisk to remove Stoned from the partition table of my
hard disk.  According to ViruScan, the hard disk is now disinfected.

BUT,....

the DiskEditor of Norton Utilities reveals some interesting stuff.  In
sector 0 0 1, what appears to be the correct partition table (I don't
have the actual code) resides up to E1.  Some distance after that, at
FD, there begins a long string which includes the lines "your pc is
now stoned", and "LEGALIZE MARIJUANA".  Thus it seems that the virus
is still present at least in some form in my hard disk.

Looking into sector 7, there is what looks to me to be a corrupted
version of the partition table; I am reluctant to test it by moving
this version into sector 1 and possibly overwriting the correct
partition table.

My guess is that MDisk removed the infectivity of the Stoned virus
from the hard disk while allowing some strings to remaiin Sector 1.
Can some netters cast more light on this? Will these viral remnants be
reactivated if I don't remove them?  What is this material sitting in
Sector 7 now; can it cause future trouble unless I rewrite nulls into
the sector now?

Thanks for any help.

 Take this scenario:

  The virus traps the hardware keyboard interrupt and sorts out
Ctrl-Alt-Del.  When it detects C-A-Del it 'simulates' a reboot through
stepping the floppy motors blanking the screen etc. After this the
computer seems to restart and voila the virus can continue its 'work'.
  Not to mention I have a description of a virus doing excactly this,
all other keyboard interrupts are passed on to the regular interrupt
handler ofcourse...

 In my view, the most important thing to remember when discussing
viruses is that if BIOS and/or Dos can do it **any program can do it**
and thus a virus can too.
 Ofcource this is true for any computer/operating system not utilizing
hardware to block the normal user out from system areas in the
machine. Not only Dos-systems. Dos-systems on the other hand are more
voulnerable(sp?)  than they need to because it is common practice for
programs to fiddle around in the system areas to get things done that
they need to do!

I've no other comments but the language certainly is German in the
latter sentence (althought, surely there must be a misspelling in the
first word 'icht'). But the first sentence ('on jo assennettu') caught
my attention because ... it's Finnish ! It also includes a misspelling

it's hardly written by a Finn. The meaning is English would be "is
