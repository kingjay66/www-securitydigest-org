VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Re: Universal virus detector

David Chess asks how my hardware timestamp forms a universal virus
detector.  He misses the point of my message.  I wasn't trying to
define a good user interface to such a system; I was only sketching
out how the hardware might work.

Any creation or modification of executable code on a system is either
desired or undesired.  You first of all have to be able to distinguish
between those two possibilities.  The distinction is based on the
intent of the operator, so is not amenable to mathematical argument as
such.

While it may sometimes be difficult to decide exactly what catagory
some transitions fall into, in many cases I can be definitive.  In
particular, there it is almost always the case that no existing
executable should be modified, ever.  All my existing executables can
be checked by comparing their timestamps with known-correct values.
Think of this as a very cheap, absolutely unforgeable checksum.

More generally, any time I am certain my system is "clean" I can
generate and save on a secure medium a list of all timestamps on my
disk.  Any time later, I can generate a new list and compare.  It is
then up to me to decide whether any differences that show up are
legitimate - but I have the absolute assurance that I WILL get an
indication of any changes.

BTW, if you really want to build such hardware you can easily go
further, in several ways.  For example, you can add a
hardware-enforced switch which when in the OFF position makes it
impossible to set the "is executable" bit at all.  In this mode, you
can't do program development, install new executables, or even copy
executable files - but you absolutely can't be infected either.  The
vast majority of systems could probably spend most of their time with
the switch in this position.

Another alternative is to add another bit, the "may create
executables" bit.  Only code running from a block marked with this bit
may turn on the "executable" bit for another block.  Normally, only
the linker and an image copier would have this bit set.  A virus could
still be written - but it couldn't modify existing code directly, it
would have to produce object code and pass it through the linker.

There are certainly some fundamental issues in dealing with viruses,
but most of the PRACTICAL issues are the direct result of PRACTICAL
hardware and software design decisions.
                                                                      -- Jerry

Subject: Removing the 4096 (PC)

There is a very easy method to get rid of the 4096 virus (100 years).
Lets say you want this virus had spread on your hard-disk and you want
to remove it.  Take an *INFECTED* PKZIP, PKARC or any other such
thing. Compress all your files (or some of them) into one file. Erase
all the compressed files from your disk and boot from a clean
diskette. Now, take a *CLEAN* PKUNZIP, PKXARC or whatever and open the
compressed file. That's it!

How does it work??? When the virus is active in memory, and you try to
read an infected file, it will only read the file until the virus
(orinial file). So, what really happens here, is that the archiver
compresses only the files without the virus.

I for one would not reccomend this site (and I strongly suspect the
majority of other campus type sites) as a recipient or study site for
virus/worm/Trojan, or what ever comes next, sources.

Security tends to be very lax, as neither the time, money or inclination
is available to change this.

I would suggest a limited number of 'bonded sites' who do take
security seriously (which may well include many Universities)
act as co-ordinators, with the possiblilty of farming out
single problems to trusted users at less secure sites.

Subject: Statistical Distributions and Virus Spreading

Does virus occurence subscribe to some statistical distribution?

Q:  Suppose there is this new virus prevention/eradication software available
    for free, but there is an update policy of either $25 per update (i.e.
    configuring for new viruses) or $100 per year for an update subscription.
    Should I purchase the subscription or should I buy each update?  i. e.
    What is the probability in the next year that more than four viruses
    (strains, clones, etc....) will occur?

    Another way of asking this would be, "Is is cost effective for me to
    purchase the update subscription."

Subject: JERUSALEM B again (PC)

A faculty member here at SUNY at Buffalo has been hit by the Jerusalem B
virus brought in on a commercially purchased program.  A blurb from the
publisher/distributor suggests scanning with either "sieve" or "scan54".
and eradicating with "M-Jerusalem".

Are any of these programs available from a bitnet or internet accessible
source?  And does this advice seem sound?

Please address any responses to me directly.

The veto message you got probably had nothing to do with the nVIR B
infection.  (However, if you'd tried to run Drawover before disinfecting
it, you probably would have gotten a message about nVIR B.)

Yup.  ADoBe Separator uses ADBS for it's creator signature.  Sadly, the Mac
OS also uses a resource called ADBS for the Apple Desktop BuS.  The latter
is executable code, while the signature resource isn't.  GateKeeper blocks
unprivileged attempts to add executable resources to file, and is obviously
mistaking the totally harmless signature resource for a nasty virus.
Stupid GateKeeper :-)  The solution here is to simply not use applications
that use resource names as their application signatures.  Stupid Adobe :-)

] Why would opening a folder require adding a resource to the desktop

The Finder keeps track of which icons to display for which files.  To do
that it stores the icons, signature resources, etc. in the DeskTop file.
If the Finder discovers an unknown file in a folder, it will attempt to
add that file's identifying info to the DeskTop.

] And why did Gatekeeper veto it on one disk, but not the other?

I dunno.  The Finder is often mysterious to the semi-initiated (like me).
Perhaps an expert can take the rest of the questions?

I would estimate that such a program would be only slightly easier
than a program to pass the Turing test. As someone pointed out, a real
computer isn't a finite state machine because it includes the person
operating it (well the whole universe has a finite number of states
but we're getting way beyond anything of practical use). Therefore
there is no universal algorithm for detecting viruses a priori. How
about a non-universal algorighm that will detect a virus say 95% of
the time? I don't think that's possible either. Consider possible
countermeasures: The virus inspects a component of the operating
system or hardware (e.g. checks if files of certain names are present,
the files in question being essential components of the operating
system), and uses the result to generate a 32-bit number which it then
uses to decrypt a chunk of data which contains the infector code. It
then executes the infector code. Even a brute-force inspect all
possible execution paths approach won't work here because infection
depends on things outside the program itself .. unless you're going to
simulate the suspect program in a simulation of an entire machine
which isn't very practical. Consider: even a good human hacker would
have great difficulty finding a cunningly-hidden virus in a big
program. You're going to need something pretty close to true AI.

A storm in a teacup I'm afraid. What possible technique could you use
to make it 'illegal to own or transmit virus source'? I mean, if in
the U.S.  you can buy books on homemade weapons from machine guns
right up to nerve gas and atomic bombs, I can't see the U.S.
Government being able to successfully crack down on people swapping
virus source code.

It seems to be a common practice on this newsgroup/mailing list to
assume guilt until shown otherwise. E.g. 'Morris is guilty writing the
Internet Worm', before a verdict has been handed down. Statements such
as 'Anyone who has virus source code must be a criminal' are of a
similar ilk.

This is strange because I seem to recall SCAN55 detecting this virus
