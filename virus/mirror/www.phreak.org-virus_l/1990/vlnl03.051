Subject: Possible Virus (PC)

I recently down-loaded a file from a local BBS called MEGASPUP.ZIP
which is flagged by SCAN58 as containing 2 viruses, 1701/1704 Ver B
and Vacsina. This program is supposed to decrease disk access time,
according to the documentation. Does anyone have any information about
this file, such as its origin etc. Also, now what do I do with it,
should I send it somewhere to be analysed ?

Is Jerusalem-B spread an indicator of the future?

Jerusalem-B (Israeli variant) was apparently shipped about 1 week ago
in a PC AT clone from one of the smaller companies.  It was on a
formatted hard drive with MS-DOS 4.01 installed.  The company
confirmed that they had been having a problem with that virus when
contacted by the upset owner.  An earlier contact with the company had
resulted in a denial of a virus problem, and a claim of shipping 300
systems per day.

The new owner, being innocent in the ways of viruses, had, within an
hour, infected his master copies of Microsoft Works and an income tax
program, and now has ordered replacements.

This is the same virus shipped by the Census Bureau several weeks ago to
about 300 users, according to published reports.

There have been detection tools for this virus for months, rather than
weeks, as in the case of some of the newer and "better" viruses.

So far, indications from my experience and surveys are that most
companies and users wait to learn from personal experience about
viruses, rather than learning from others.

Are these infections (with an old virus) an indication of what will
happen when the large number of new viruses have had time to spread far
enough?

Or will the increasing availability of virus scanning tools and
self-checking programs (like MS Works) intersect the "infected systems
curve" soon?

I don't recall seeing an "average rate of adoption" study for techniques
to counter new classes of threats to information systems, but it appears
that it may be in the 10%/year range or lower, at least initially.

Subject: Memory Scans for Viruses (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee
=================================================================

        Nino Margetic raised a good point yesterday that I have not
seen discussed yet.  His question was - "why would a virus be detected
in memory when there is no indication of the virus in any of the
system's files?".  A very good question.
        To begin with, as Nino pointed out, the system was infected
and then disinfected.  Herein lies the mystery.  In the disinfection
process files are read in through the DOS internal buffers,
disinfected and written back out -- again passing through the DOS
internal buffers.
        DOS has a very peculiar habit of insisting that all file
creations occupy a full cluster, whether you need it or not, and
rather than zeroing out the remainder of the cluster, DOS further
insists on padding the remainder with whatever is currently hanging
out unused in the buffer area.  Why it does the I do not know --
perhaps a sense of nostalgia for what was once useful code -- who
knows, but in any case this is what it does.
        When a file is disinfected then, and written back as a clean
file, everything beyond the end of file mark is residual from whatever
has passed through the DOS buffers.  Inevitably, pieces of the
original virus will end up in the buffer area, located just at the end
of the disinfected program.  These virus pieces are then written to
the disk as filler for the remainder of the cluster.  This process is
not unique to disinfecting.  Any file creations performed while a
system is infected may have this end result.
        Now, whenever the file is scanned, DOS reads to the end of the
file mark and passes the information to the scan routine.  SCAN sees a
clean file, as indeed it is.  However, in the process of scanning the
file, DOS had to read the entire cluster into the internal buffers
(God knows why -- perhaps, again, from some sense of nostalgia for
lost data) and in the process it may bring pieces of the virus into
its buffers.  A memory scan will then detect this.  The virus is of
course not functional or harmful at this point.
        It is possible, of course, to design a memory scan that could
differentiate between a live and a dead virus.  But this would cause
weaknesses in the memory scan function due to possible modifications
of the virus by unknown hackers that would fool the scan.  It's easy
to relocate code.  Not so easy to re-code the segments that being
scanned for (assuming the hacker does not know the segments being used
as the I.D.).  In any case, that's neither here nor there.  The causes
of Nino's observations are hopefully exposed. ....

Another forward from John McAfee:
========================================================================

        I think that I forgot to answer the implied question in Nino
Margetic's posting -- "If, after a disinfection, t file scan says I'm
clean but the memory scan flags the virus, what do I believe?"
Believe the file scan.  Except for the following viruses - 4096, 512
and EDV.  If it happens with any of these three then give us a call.

Often? How often? I know about a version of WordPerfect and that's
all.

Well, the file was *already* destroyed when it was infected. If you
disinfect it you won't cause more damage (besides the false sense of
security). If you don't have the appropriate backups (or the
originals, of course), you have only two possibilities --- to leave
the file destroyed but infected and to leave it destroyed but *not*
infected. I prefer the second solution, since the first will continue
to spread the infection. Of course, you can also completely delete the
file.

Ooops! Files, which are *infected* by the Vienna virus can *always* be
recovered. In all cases. You cannot recover the files *destroyed* by
this virus (with their first 5 bytes overwritten), but this is the
case with all files destroyed by a virus. (They know well how to
destroy our data, these nasty things :-).)

OK, OK! I agree that it is better to have backups. But it is *best* to
have *both* backups and a disinfector. If this was not true all the
work done by the antivirus researchers would be useless. This forum
would be useless too. It is relatively easy (if you have non-infected
backups, of course) to recover from any virus attack --- even if it
was performed by the most sophisticated virus. You have only to follow
a set of computer hygiene rules, which fin on a half page. Even that
dumb fool --- the so-called average user can be teach to follow
them.... Hmmm, can he? :-)

CAN BE?! Whey *were* constructed. The 1701/1704 virus contains only a
small piece of code which can be scanned for --- all the rest is
encrypted. The virus uses the file length as an encryption key ---
therefore the encrypted part is always (well, almost always)
different. And there exist much more clever viruses like the 4096 and
the 1260 viruses, in which even the (small) part which is not
encrypted and which is used to decrypt the rest of the virus, even
this small part is somewhat different for every infected file. (Well,
I think so, I have no examples of these viruses.)

And it is also possible to design a virus (hey, catch that virus
writer who is reading this behind your back :-)), which will be
impossible to be recognized --- in the file. The virus itself will not
be able to say if a file is already infected. Eventually, there will
be two (or more) copies of the virus in the file. But when the file is
run, the virus will figure out that there is something after it and
will strip it off the file. It is hard to implement such a thing, but
once someone gets the idea, it will be much easier --- remember the
problem "write a program which outputs its own source".

      Yes. Novell Networks use function E0 of int 21h for the print
spooler. For that reason, if I execute an infected program, the server
and the stations hangs. (On the server, before it hangs, the LAN
manager prints a message that an interrupt vector was try to changed).

      I tested versions B and B-2 of the Jerusalem virus and the two
versions produce the same efect (hangs the stations and server).

      I didn't tested IMMUNE on a Novell Network. But any program that
try to detect the Jerusalem Virus through function E0 int 21h, hangs
the computers on a Novell Network.

      In a Novell Network or other LAN you can use John Mcaffe's
NETSCAN to search infected programs. (This program is on SIMTEL20 in
the directory PD:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>).

   No. The file isn't infected if the contents of the word at offset 02
   in the file is 12Eh. (i.e. If I have an infected program, this always
   have the word 12Eh at offset 02, because this word is part of an
   instruction of the virus).

   No. If the contents of the word at offset 02 (Number of bytes
   contained in last page) is equal to the negated contents of the
   word at offset 12h (negative sum of all the words in the file),
   then the program ISN'T INFECTED.
   (In the process of infection, the virus negates the number of bytes
    contained in the last page of the EXE program, and this value it
    puts at offset 12h of the header (i.e. as the negative sum of all
    the words in the file).

   I completely agree with you.

Subject: Viruses and Copyrights (Part 2)

     This is to continue my earlier posting on copyrights and viruses,
based upon _How to Copyright Software_ by M.J. Salone.  This posting
is in regards to derivative works; for example, a disassembly of a
virus made by someone other than the virus author.

     Congress defines the term 'derivative work'as "a work based upon
one or more pre-existing works." [17 USC Sec. 101] A virus disassembly
would probably fall under this definition because the opcodes are
presumably from the actual virus even though the descriptive comments
are the creative input of the person disassembling it.  The above
definition is likely to apply if a disassembly is considered to be a
translation of the virus.  The question then becomes "Is the
disassembly author required to get the permission of the person who
holds the copyright (usually the author) before publishing the
disassembly?"  The answer is, technically, yes.

     However, the absence of a copyright notice could be a legitimate
excuse for assuming that the virus is public domain; this is backed up
by the fact that viruses are designed to replicate themselves without
consent of the user.  Items within the public domain are free to be
used and distributed in any way.  Derivative works of public domain
items can be copyrighted as long as the new material is substantial
enough to be considered original.  As far as disassemblies are
concerned, the aforementioned descriptive comments are original
material and can thus be copyrighted (i.e. the whole disassembly).

     Of course there is the question of whether-or-not a virus is
considered to be properly copyrightable anyway, as other contributors
to Virus-L have noted.  Viruses install themselves into other
programs, thus creating aunauthorized derivative works in the process!

     Please note that, if the above is untrue, then the disassembly
can not be published without the consent of the virus' copyright
holder.  The copyright holder of a work solely has the right to
publish derivative works based upon his/her original publication
during the duration of the copyright.

     In my opinion the disassembly is copyrightable because the virus
is in the public domain (since copyright notices are not normally
found in viruses; not to mention that viruses may themselves be
somewhat illegal).  I I doubt that a virus author would sue for
infringement because, as I said in my previous posting, that the virus
author is likely to incrimminate himself by doing so.

[Ed. For what it's worth, I believe that some versions of the Brain
virus included a copyright notice in the ASCII header.]

     My next posting will contain a discussion on what rights are
protected by a copyright.

DISCLAIMER:  The above are my opinions.  I'm not a lawyer :-)  Please do
             not take this material to be the law.
