I have a clone that beeps whenever there is a static discharge in the
neighborhood.  (There is another computer plugged into the keyboard
port through a box and the combination seems to be an antenna.)  If
you could find a similar cause, your blood pressure might go down a
bit.

Subject: Yet another info about the saddam virus (PC)

Hello all,
I'm sorry for all those mail's  but I'm just a starter...

The new info concerns the temporary damage and the permanent damage...
The temporary one is printing a string the counter is counting just the
following functions of INT 21h:
3Dh, 0Fh, 4Bh, 0Eh, 5Bh, 16h, 3Ch, 41h, 13h, 56h, and 17h.

the permanent damage is changing the first 3 bytes but it seems that
the virus restores those bytes after the virus install himself... this
means the program wont be truly damaged and would run just fine... the
virus also stores for this porpuse the first 3 bytes...

Subject: Re: Jerusalem B (PC)

  John Councill asks several questions about the Jerusalem B virus.
Although all of them have been answered on VIRUS-L before, I guess
there are enough new readers to warrant posting the answers here
again:

>... behavior of the virus with WP v5.0 and the Turbo Pascal.  Both of
>these programs were invokable, and the behavior upon invocation was
>different than with WP v4.2.  With WP v4.2 it scanned both disk drives

>infected the resident portion of DOS, and then tried to run WP.  With

>activity.

The behavior with WP 4.2 is anomalous since the length of this file
as reported in the EXE header is less than its actual length.  As a
result, the virus overwrites part of the file instead of appending
itself to it, meaning that no disinfectant utility can restore WP 4.2
after it has been infected by this virus.
  BTW, the scanning of disk drives which you report was not being done
by the virus, but by WP 4.2.  (I think the part of it which is in me-
mory is looking for additional code in the file, and finding that the
file is corrupt, it starts looking for it on other disks.  Or some-
thing like that.)

>1) What is the behavior of Jerusalem B?  Does it do anything vile
>other than infect all of the .COM and .EXE files that it can find (or
>so I thought, see #2 below...)?

If it gets into memory when the system date is a Friday the 13th, it
will cause any file which is executed to be deleted.  On any other
date, after it has been in memory for 30 minutes, it will cause all
activity to be slowed down and a rectangular region of the screen to
be scrolled up by two lines.

>2) ... Does Jerusalem B only infect programs that are invoked from the
>command prompt while it is in memory?  Or is it supposed to infect all
>.COM and .EXE files that it finds?

It infects all executable program files invoked while it is in memory,
except COMMAND.COM.

>3) Under what conditions does a multiple infection occur (one
>executable file found to have multiple copies of the virus in it)?

Whenever the file is an EXE file.

>4) Are there many versions of Jerusalem B out in the world, making the
>above questions inappropriate and/or difficult to answer?

The total number of versions of the Jerusalem which have been reported
is well over 10, but only the original version (what McAfee calls
"Jerusalem-B" for some obscure reason) is very common.  The multiple-
infection bug has been removed in most of the later versions, and the
slowdown and scrollup have been removed in some of them.  Some ver-
sions are much more destructive than the original.

  I might add that some of the information on this virus given in
Patricia Hoffman's VSUMxxxx file is inaccurate, particularly the
claims that it can survive a warm reboot and that the slowdown is by a
factor of 10.

Subject: Windows Trojan ? (MS-DOS)

	Have not had a chance to verify yet but want to pass on a
warning: Received a file that alledgedly sets the cursor in Windows.
The file is contained in WINCURS.ZIP and is called CURSE.EXE. It is
Windows aware and will not run under plain DOS except to print a
message.

	According to the user, when run under Windows, it modifies the
LOAD= command in the .INI file so that it is always executed. It is
said that any information that was in the LOAD= section is trashed.

	Once invoked, files appear to have a copy of the first FAT
sector written randomly into them. It is said that this affects ANY
file (executable or data). After a period of time (from the
description) the FAT is destroyed.

	I have a copy of the file & as soon as it can be properly
examined, I will post a full description.

Hi,

Does anyone here in Aust archive security bulletins and/or other
publications from NIST?  I know that csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.48.87)
has them, but in the sake of bandwidth would prefer to gather these
docs from Aust...

To Members of the Virus Forum:

    The Vulnerability Assessment Laboratory is currently working on
the development of a methodology for the assessment of the
vulnerability of computer systems to computer viruses and malicious
code. We are currently looking for information and technical
interchange with any organization involved in the study of computer
viruses and malicious code. Working group meetings will be planned and
standard definitions for computer virus and malicious code terms will
be set. A working group under the IEEE Computer Society, Security and
Privacy Technical Committee is also being formed to look into computer
viruses and malicious code. For information on either effort please
contact Anthiny L.  Barnes at:

Subject: Hypercard virus. Anybody seen it? (Mac)

I've been experiencing weird crashes with HyperCard on my mac as of
late for reasons I can't fathom and I read in the disinfectant 2.0 on
line help that there is a HyperCard virus.  Does anybody know what the
symptoms for this virus are or how to get rid of it if one is
infected?  How about the vector?  Any and all information is
appreciated.

Subject: Possible Boot-Sector Virus in Shrink-Wrapped Software (PC)

Dear colleague,

this is meant to both warn you from the software cited below and get
some help against a possible new virus.

Today, a disk marked "Diskette zum Buch 'Programmieren mit PostScript',
IBM-360-Kbyte-Format - Version 1.0, Bestell-Nr. 90337 / 01069054rv"
from the publisher "Markt & Technik" was taken out of its shrink-wrap
cover, fitted with a write-protect tab, then used to boot one of our
IBM compatibles (a Siemens PCD-2). Later that day, F-OSCHK claimed
that the boot sector and the partition record of this very computer's
hard disk have been modified.

This evening, I had a look on the Markt & Technik diskette with
F-DISINF and F-BOOT and found these results:

> F-DISINF    Disinfects boot sectors    Version 1.12 - July '90
>
> This boot sector is not an usual DOS boot sector.
> It may be infected with an unknown virus.

> F-BOOT    Shows the boot sector    Version 1.12 - July '90

I also booted the PCD-2 from a write-protected DOS diskette, then had
a look on its hard disk with F-DISINF, F-BOOT and F-PBR (from a write-
protected F-PROT diskette) finding:

Neither did F-FCHK find any infected files on the hard disk.

Unfortunately, I have no copies of that hard disk's previous boot sector
and partition boot record to compare the above to.

If I boot from the hard disk in spite of F-OSCHK's warnings, F-MMAP
(from a write-protected diskette) shows the usual memory map (from
visual inspection only, i.e. addresses and lengths not checked).

Now, several possibilities come to mind:

1. The M&T diskette contains some hitherto unknown boot-sector virus
   (either directly from the publisher, or the retail store has taken
   back the software and re-wrapped it).

2. The M&T diskette contains a boot sector that is not quite a virus,
   but tampers with the hard-disk's boot sectors, for some unknown
   purpose.

3. The M&T diskette is clean (though strange), and the hard-disk's boot
   sectors have been tampered with by some other program, during the day.

4. The M&T diskette is clean (though strange), and somebody has changed
   F-OSCHK's checksums in the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the hard disk. However,
   this file is dated 17 Sep 90, and the checksums equal those in a
   second file, OSNUMBER, dated 28 Aug 90.

I reckon, the fourth possibility is pretty improbable, as the intruder
would have had to change 2 files, also forging their creation dates.
But I'm not sure about the other three.

Of course, we will check with the retail-store, and with the publisher.
Anyway, can you contribute more insight?
- -- Have you used the cited software, and had any problems?
- -- Can you make some sense of the above boot records?
- -- Or have you seen similar boot records, before?
- -- Can you imagine other reasons than the ones given above for F-OSCHK
   to balk?
- -- What do you suggest to mend the situation?

Please reply privately or through VIRUS-L.
Many thanks in advance

The first boot sector in your posting is actually quite innocent;
it just prints the messages

         This disk is not bootable

      If you wish to make it bootable,
     run the DOS program SYS after the
          system has been loaded

     Please insert a DOS diskette into
      the drive and strike any key...

waits for a keystroke, and then reboots via INT 19.  Is that in
fact what happened when you booted from it?   If not, perhaps
there's a confusion of diskettes, and some other diskette may
be infected with something?   Of course, there's always the
possibility that some executable file on the diskette (or
some other diskette) is infected with something, or is
otherwise nefariously altering boot sectors.

The other two boot sectors also look mostly innocent.  Except
for the BPB area (describing the disk capacity etc), and an
"80" just before the '55AA' at the end, the second one is
identical to my own DOS 3.3 boot record on my C:.   The last
looks like a legitimate master boot record to casual inspection,
although it's a bit different from mine.

Possibly F-OSCHK was somehow fooled by something (a new device
driver?) in the system?   Or perhaps some program made some
non-viral changes to the boot sector(s), as part of a copy-prot
scheme or something like that?  (That might explain that "80",
although there's also likely some other explanation that I'm
just overlooking.)

Um, how thoroughly have you tested that?   From looking at the
code, it appears that it will only work if the current INT21
vector points at the virus's far-JMP.   That won't be true,
I don't think, if any INT21-hooking programs have been run
since the virus installed itself (or, for viruses like the
4096 that find the "real" DOS entry point in various ways,
if any INT21-hooking programs have been installed at all).
INT21-hooking programs are very common (NDOSEDIT and so on);
if they stop your detector from working, you might want to
include that as a caveat when distributing it...

Subject: HELP!! (PC)

Okay.  Here's the problem...  I turned on my computer today, and
something came on my screen that siad it was some sort of utility.  It
was called "KONAN" utility.  It stopped, paused, and asked me for my
choice.  My choices were like reboo and a bunch of other things.  I
don't have this "utility", and have never seen it before.  What should
I do?  I booted off of a floppy.  Am I preventing this from spreading
(I write protected this diskette with a piece of tape.).

How do I get the latest versions of virus
detecting/identifying/removing software?  I have Scan v63 and Clean57.
I know that these aren't the latest versions.  Any help would be
GREATLY appreciated...

Subject: Alleged PostScript virus

I act as the virus guru/killer for a group of designers working on
Macintoshes, and get most of my information on new virii and means to
kill `em from this group.

Recently both MacWorld and MacUser magazines have had short articles
about a PostScript printer virus which apparently is a Trojan Horse
hidden within some public domain clip art. According to the articles,
the virus, when down-loaded into a PostScript printer, resets a chip
password and renders the printer unusable.

I took these articles with some grains of salt, since the phrases,
"alleged," "supposedly," "appears to," is liberally used throughout
both of them. Plus, I've not seen any comments from this group about
this virus.  So, two questions: Can anyone confirm whether there
actually *is* a PostScript Trojan, and if so, strategies for
preventing and killing it.

Thanks.
