VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: Gatekeeper 1.1.1 & Scores (Mac)

The following is an excerpt of a letter sent to John Norstadt, Author of
disinfectant and may be of interest to anyone who uses gatekeeper
____________________________________________________________________

    John, I'm sending this to you because I think it may be of interest.  I
just downloaded gatekeeper 1.1.1 off the rice archives and was in the
process of evaluating its performance against scores, nVir and WDEF.
Immediately I found a problem.  When starting up an application already
infected with scores (on a floppy) gatekeeper announced 3 times that the
virus was attempting to infect the application and its attempt was 'vetoed'
Great so far.  However, after that initial warnining I waited about 10
minutes and then checked on the process of the attempted infection.  By
that time, pyro had come on and nothing was any different BUT when I
checked the system folder the notepad file and scrapbook files had the
'dogeared page' icon.  I ran disinfectant 1.6 and guess what the system was
infected as well as the desktop, clipboard and scrapbook.
    It seems that gatekeeper only partly protects from scores attacks.  And
worse yet disinfectant had to be run twice to completely remove all bits
and pieces of scores.

Subject: Disinfectant 1.7 and GateKeeper (Mac)

Disinfectant 1.7 requires GateKeeper privileges even when just scanning.
Earlier versions only required privileges when repairing.  I wasn't aware of
this until after I had released 1.7, or I would have mentioned it in the
document.

The solution to this problem is to simply grant Disinfectant all six
GateKeeper privileges.

This is I think the fourth serious attempt on this newsgroup to propose a
universal virus detector. Unfortunately like all the rest it won't work.

How? I haven't copied your entire posting in this followup because it was too
long but I couldn't see any proposed method for validating the detector code.
And an obvious way to defeat your mechanism is to overwrite the detector
program with code that always says "OK".

What do you mean? Another obvious way to defeat the detector is to recalculate
CRCs for infected programs and put the new CRC value into the table. I don't
see any way to prevent this other than storing the table offline (which would
create what most users would consider unacceptable hassle).

Also your detector would detect most resident programs as well as multiuser
systems and upgraded versions of the operating system as viruses because it
checks the system call vectors.

Hello netlanders,

Another topic on viruses. The german computer-journal "DOS-Shareware"
reported the following in it's No. 3 issue :

There is an infected version of SCANV58.zip. Actually the VALIIDATE
program seems to be changed. The original VALIDATE should be a .COM
file, while the corrupt is a .EXE with  46167 bytes (instead of 6485)
The original SCAN.EXE should have the values: Size: 42977 bytes,
Date: 2-15-1990, File Authentication:  Check Method 1: 2F16, Method 2:
1C57.
This message is to be found on page 77 of the above journal.

Also there are to files  "NORTSTOP.ZIP" and "NORTSHOT.ZIP" which
claim to be written by peter norton. Both contain a trojan which
erases some files between christmas and new year. To identify those
look in the .ZIP file for NORTSHOT.EXE and in the .EXE for the string
"Norton Public". If you find those trojan please inform Tony McNamara
from Norton computing (phone: US: 213/319-2076). The length of NORTSHOT
is 38907 bytes and it's date is 02.01.89 (European format I suppose).
This message is from page s6 of the above journal.

This message will be sent to RED-UG and games-l (Apr. 8. 1990).

I am willing to start a new mothly posting, which includes validation

These comments are based on the abstract only, not the paper
(I'll eventually figure out how to FTP from here...).

Modification detectors seem like a promising way of detecting at
least some "new" (not seen before) viruses.   The usual problems
faced by a modification detector include:

 1) A virus that knows about the detector (or about a class
    of them to which it belongs) might make changes that the
    detector won't detect.
 2) A similarly detector-aware virus might update the detector's
    database to reflect the changes it makes when it infects.
 3) A virus might (by luck or design) modify files in such a way
    that the user, presented with a list of files that have
    changed, will not notice anything wrong.
 4) If the virus is active in the system when the detector runs,
    it could lie to the detector about the state of the system.

A simple CRC approach runs into point (1): if lots of people start
using your detector, and it always uses the same CRC polynomial,
it's not all that hard for the virus to include code that patches
infected objects so that the CRC is the same as it was before
infection; a CRC isn't hard to invert.   My favorite solution to
this is to allow the user to specify his own polynomial (through
the use of a "key phrase" or whatever); other solutions also
exist (crypto-based MDC's and such).  I gather from the abstract
that the exact scheme used isn't fixed by the proposal; that's
a reasonable approach.

I gather that your point (f)
> f.  In order to prevent a virus from attacking the CRC table, we will
>     add a set of dynamic "State Vectors" for the machine, which define

is supposed to deal with my point (2), but I don't really
understand it.  If it's possible for the detector to update the
database (and it must be, when the user gets new pieces of
software and so on), then it's possible for a virus to as well,
if the database is ever r/w to the system while the virus is
active.

(3) is one of the harder problems, I think; in some of the
environments that are most important to protect (program
development environments, for instance), many executables
will be expected to change.   Helping the user figure out
which changes are OK and which are not is something that
needs considerable thinking about, I think.  Doing it
perfectly is probably impossible (a good reason to avoid
calling anything a "universal" virus detector...).

Most of the abstract seems to be devoted to (4); making sure
the virus isn't lurking anywhere when the detector runs.
This is the general computer-security problem of getting the
system into a trusted state; I tend to think that the
problem needs to be solved at the system level rather than
the application level (that is, there should be a good
wired-in procedure for getting the system into a trusted state,
rather than making every security application program do
it itself).   I doubt that any piece of software in DOS can
really determine that the system is trustworthy; checking
interrupt vectors doesn't tell you anything about the code
they're pointing to, for instance.  Painful as it is, the
only method I know of that I trust is booting cold from a
trusted floppydisk.

Sounds like an interesting project, though, and I -will- try
to get the full paper...

Subject: FTP and .hqx (Mac)

Since I run through vast amounts of sw on various servers about the net,
and it always seems to work for me, try this:

1) ftp to whereever.
2) GET the file. No binary, no translate, zilch.
3) Transfer it up with Kermit.

My feeling is that you may be trashing the file by insisting on
transferring it as binary when it isn't. HQX format (as is used on the
FTP servers I know of) is ASCII only, designed not to get trashed by
character translations (e.g., EBCDIC to ASCII). Try not doing anything
but the transfer, and I think you'll find this will work.

Macintosh datafiles, as I understand them, have 2 parts, a resource
fork and a data fork.  Anything in resource fork (so I've been told)
can execute.  Does this imply that one could bury a virus in the
resource fork of a data file?

I'm sure that this has been hashed over before.

Just a quick note to apologise for disruption to the archive service at
Heriot-Watt over the last month. The network core is due to change to a
Sun system from an ageing Vax, in the meantime a re-organisation of archive
service will take place.

Normal service for immediate processing of email will be restored by end May.
The archive contents will be extended to include the following:

1. General document archives (viruses)
2. PC, Mac, Amiga, Atari and Apple 2 anti-viral software
3. Archives of CERT, DDN SC and other advisories
4. Patches for BSD Unix releases
5. Risks digest backissues
6. Virus-l digest backissues

In addition I am considering a protocol for access to more sensitive materials
including backissues of the Zardoz security digest, Phage mailing list
(historical material from the Internet worm period), and other lists.

These will probably be available by restricted NIFTP.

Again apologies for the disruption.

A counterexample to this assertion is the wdef viruses on the macs.  They are
carried in the Desktop file which is a data file describing the layout of the

You're saying that you can quickly read the source code to an entire compiler
and understand everything it does?  I find this extremely hard to believe.
