VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

	In a recent mesage to VIRUS-L, this query was posted:

From:    T.TENG@Macbeth.Stanford.EDU (T. Teng)
Subject: Is this worth $75? (PC)

Someone told me that his product:
1. COMPLETELY protects against invasion of operating system viruses;
2. Prevents the spread of file viruses on hard or floppy disks; and
3. Searches out and suppresses file viruses.
How much protection does this give? Is it worth $75?
Thanks for any answers/comments.
- -----------------------------------------------------------
	I think you might get better answers if you gave the
name of the product, and the person or company that makes
it. Perhaps someone else has used it, and can give a review.
As for "Is it worth $75", I'd say maybe so, but F-PROT is
available for a $10 donation, and has programs which can
take care of floppy and hard disk viruses. I don't know
if everything is automatic. However, you can check this
for free, and if it don't do what you want, get rid of
it, and go for the $75 program.

Subject: Info about InterNet Worm wanted

	I remember some months ago a posting that described in brief
the what, who, where, why and how of the InterNet Worm.

	At the time my interest in the subject was marginal so I read
the posting quickly and just as quickly forgot it.

	Now, my interest in the subject has been renewed and I am
searching for any information concerning it, especially the who,
where, why and what. I am not after source code, nor do I intend on
writing my own virus from the information gained. The reasons for
collecting this information are purely for interests sake.

	If you have the original posting, or any extra information, I
would appreciate it if you could mail it to me at the address in the
header.

Thanks in Advance

I would be interested in more details as to why it is called the IDF virus.
I have never heard about it here in Israel.

Hm.   I think you may be.   An EXE file can be any length, and
a virus can add any length to it.   In general, a virus will
round the length of the host file up to a multiple of 16 bytes
*before* adding the virus code (because that's the only easy
way to do it).   So, for instance, an EXE infector that was
921 bytes long (just an example) adding itself to an EXE file
that was 1590 bytes long would first round the victim up to
1600, and then add the 921, for a total of 2521.   Something
like that.  I'm not entirely positive that all this is true,
but I think it is!   *8)                     DC

fairly simple.  There are some of us who always want to say "we got
here first".  Any report by anyone will have the counter: "In 1926 I
saw that and did not publish it."  Well I say too bad.  If you did not
report it (and McAfee did not) then it did not happen.

Thanks for this first report.

On my system (a 386 equipped with an AMI BIOS) the setup-program
(ROM-resident) asks you whether you want the BIOS to use a stack area
somewhere in low memory or you want it to reduce your base memory size
by 1 K. I am not sure what this area is being used for - I guess it is
used to store the user configurable HD drive information, but I am not
sure. I do not believe you have a bug - what you could do is use Quaid
Analyzer or a similar debugger to look into that top area of RAM (You
might have to patch it back to 640k by changing 0:413 hex [dw]). By
looking at the data stored there, you should be able to find out what
is going on there. If that doesn't help, you could still use the Quaid
Analyzer function "Go until memory location is modified" to trace the
system starting at the boot so you can see at which point data is
written to the hidden area.  Not to forget: Quaid Analyzer itself also
uses such a technique to hide itself from debugged programs if it is
used in 'boot' mode.

Kind regards,

The method you mention (scanning for a bit pattern at a certain
position, taking bytes from a certain offset within the viral code and
copying them to the beginning of the program in my opinion is
exteremely dangerous and should not be used. We will experience a LOT
of viruses that will carry identical signatures and will store the
original code at a different offset within their code to fool
anti-virus programs like McAffees' into destroying programs they are
trying to recover.

Perfect agreement with that - but it could even get worse: Imagine
virus derivates deliberately placing JMPs to killer code within their
body at the location where a recovery program expects the original
start of the program.  Consequences would be disastrous because
viruses could be 'tailormade' to certain anti-virus programs.

Now how could they be supposed to know about all these viruses if the
only thing any virus writer has to do is change 1 (one) byte at the
right location of the virus to make virtually ALL removal programs
destroy data. We will have to find a way to describe viruses in a way
that will enable us to recognize and to react to some derivates.

To wrap it up, removal of a virus should ONLY be performed by a
program if it has found a virus and identified ALL it's code (not just
some short part of the code). If a single byte of the code found
differs from the 'known' virus, the removal program should not attempt
to mess around with it. A combination of signature scanning and
checksumming comes up to my mind when I think about the dillema again:
First check, if the (known) virus CAN be in the program assumed to be
infected by using a signature the way we use it today and then use a
range definition file to define the location of static fields within
virus code and calculate checksums over that code area. If these
checksums match, we can safely remove the virus from the file. Of
course other algorithmic methods have to be used for 4096 and the
like.

There is hope after all    :-)

Subject: Commercial Jockeying

I am disappointed in seeing people with commercial products at stake air
their differences on Virus-L.  It might be a good idea to take those
problems elsewhere.  Ray Glath and John McAfee both have more at stake
then altruism.  I am surprised that either of them has the time to go
"gunning" for the other.

My day is crowded enough without having to read this kind of trivia.  Who
announced the first US 4096 occurance and who's product caught it is just
not the least bit important unless you own that product.  What IS
important is that SEVERAL products exist that do issolate it and that we
are generally informed of its known progress.

Gentlemen... please take the flag waving to another forum.

It had to happen sooner or later.  Fortunatly, there is a fix.  I have
been distributing a routine for some time, that allowed you to reset
the password on the laser.  I have certain rules about how it gets
distributed.  The code that I have allows you to read and write any
location in the EEPROM.  Because of that, I require a signed request
on letterhead (department , company or institution), as well as an
email message.  However, an aquaintance from over in UK has just
posted a routine over on comp.lang.postscript that overcomes these
problems.  It just basicaly reads the eeprom.  Nothing more.  It reads
the password, and returns it to you.  Once you have the existing
password, you can then reset the password using the standard method
allowed in postscript.  This routine is relatively benign, in that it
simply reports the password, and allows you to set the password back
to the default password.  It may have already passed by your machine,
as it was posted within the last week. I'll try to dig it up, but if
anyone gets it, please post it here.

Cheers

[Ed. Is this virus specific to Apple LaserWriters, or can it affect
other PostScript printers?  Even if it is specific to LWs, that
certainly doesn't limit it to just Macintosh environments, so I've
removed the "(Mac)" from the subject line.  Please correct me if I'm
wrong.]

I just finished writing the routine to disinfect the Fellowship virus
(called 1022 above).  The virus code itself is in fact 1019 bytes, at
least in the version I have.  Actually, files may grow by less than
1019 bytes, as the virus may overwrite the last few bytes of the
programs it infects, making 100% disinfection impossible.  A 1022-byte
version may exist, however.

About .EXE infections in general...many viruses first pad the programs they
infect with 1-15 bytes of garbage, so their length becomes a multiple of
16 bytes.  The virus code is then added , but as it is of a fixed length,
the length of the infected file MOD 16 will be constant for a given virus.
This padding is done to ensure the virus starts on a paragraph boundary,
making it possible to set the initial IP value to a fixed number.  A
disinfection program may be able to remove the virus, but probably not
those extra 1-15 bytes.

Other viruses just appent the virus code to the file, and set the initial IP
value to a number that depends on the length of the original file MOD 16.
