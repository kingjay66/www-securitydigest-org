I just wanted to mention that we already have one virus which is able to load
itself above the 640K barrier.   The E.D.V. boot sector virus starts to
look for free ram at E800:0000 and moves downward in 64K jumps - skipping the
area 9800-B000

As an extra twist, the virus will attempt to crash any program scanning high
memory - in intercepts the "timer-tick" interrupt, and if it finds that ES or
DS point to the region where it is hiding, it will halt the computer.

This of course makes scanning for this virus a bit complicated.

My opinion is the exact opposite - Using the file length was OK while
we only had a few viruses, but now that we have over 200, it just does
not work any more, as many totally unrelated viruses may have the same
length.

Just take 1701 and 1704 as an example.

We have

     1701 - original version of Cascade, which activated in the fall of '88,
          - the "every year" version.
          - "Jo-Jo", a related, but quite different virus.
          - a 1701 byte variant of the "Phoenix" virus from Bulgaria.

     1704 - The IBM infecting variant of Cascade.
          - The non-IBM infecting variant of Cascade.
          - The Yugoslavian "Y" variant of Cascade.
          - The "multiple infection" variant of Cascade.
          - The disk-formatting variant of Cascade.
          - The Bulgarian Phoenix virus.
          - The Phoenix-D virus.

and possibly a few more which I do not remember right now.

Besides, how is the virus length to be determined - just take a common
virus like Jerusalem.  Should it be called "1808" (EXE) or "1813" (COM) ?

Subject: Re: vaccine viruses - a poor analogy

We've been generating a lot of steam about vaccine viruses lately.
Some of those who support the idea want to back it up by the analogy
between computer viruses and human viruses.

Critics of the idea have pointed out that the vaccine against a virus
is adminstered with consent, which is true. However an even more
fundamental point is that biological viruses evolve under natural
constraints. Computer viruses, however, evolve under the divine
intervention of human beings. So unless we are willing to accept that
there are deities affecting the evolution biological viruses, the
analogy breaks down. Yes I know the viral-based vaccines are
engineered by humans. But in the case of the "live" ones, they go on
and evolve by themselves, as opposed to computer vaccine viruses which
would probably evolve by tampering alone.

Subject: antiviruses can be good

I like the idea of anti-viruses, I think they can be a good thing, but
I also think they should be illegal and the writing of them should
have the same punishment as a destructive virus for 2 reasons:

 1) If they have bugs they can be destructive.
 2) They are legally indistinguishable from other viruses.

I like the idea of anti-viruses because they can help people who are
unaware of a virus problem on their system without bothering them.
They could potentially kill the spread of destructive viruses before
they ever get to some unwary users who would have gotten hurt if it
weren't for the anti-virus.

And people who are aware of viruses will easily squelch the
anti-viruses with software that they are already paying for and using.

An anti-virus could be written to infect only certain types of

Subject: Desktop Manager for WDEF/CDEF (Mac)

What an idea... maybe.

In order to avoid the CDEF and WDEF viruses, won't the Desktop Manager
work?  By removing the Desktop file, they won't be able to infect that
file.  Also, this is, I believe, shipped with new Mac systems.  I
understand that the Desktop Manager and its cohorts, Desktop DB and
Desktop DF, are more efficient than the old Desktop.

The "Desktop" is not recreated if you "rebuild the Desktop" after the
Desktop Manager is installed.  (I don't know if the Desktop is removed
when it is "rebuilt;" I just removed mine by hand.)  I guess it updates
the DB and DF files.

When I installed the DT Manager, documents weren't finding their
creator until I rebuilt the desktop, but I haven't had any problems
since.

Let me/us know if there would be any problems with this.

This is not exactly true.  Although the person getting the vaccine (or
their parents) hopefully understand the risks and benifits, the Salk
vaccine actually spreads to non-vaccinated people, transmitting the
benifits of the vaccine to them without their knowledge or consent.
That is why the Salk vaccine is used, rather than a killed virus
vaccine.

First of all let's follow-up to comp.virus, but I'll post also to
c.b.i.p.d because it has some relevance to this group as well. 

At the University of Vaasa we had a similar experience when we
bought six new 386 PCs from a very small local dealer (at a favorble
price).  The VGA driver programs that came with the delivery
contained a Sunday virus, and very nearly caused nasty havoc but for
the astuteness of one user.  The dealer is not really the one to
blame here (his knowledge of PCs being very limited :-) but the
original importer.  The annoying thing is that when told them about
the virus, the importer just shrugged it off, and may still be at
it.  We seriously considered suing, but finally decided against it. 

The lesson here is the same as yours.  Don't trust any sources. 
This goes for ftp sites as well.  We do our best to guard against
these eventualities, and nothing has happened yet, but no absolute
guarantees can be given.

Actually, that's not entirely true. One of the reasons for using the
attentuated virus vaccine instead of the killed virus vaccine, other than
the improved protection, is that people who have not been vaccinated but
come in contact with recently vaccinated individuals (generally other kids
at schools or day-cares) will be infected by the attenuated virus and get
the same immunity.

MSDOS 4.x has monkeyed around rather severly with the int 25 and int
226 call If the CX register is ffff (an illegal value under dos 3.x)
it presumes that the registers are used diffrently in order to support
the new 32 bit fat table.  This may cause severe system crashes and
file corruptions.

James Li posts a message about trashed disks.

o.k., I would say that you have no infected disks, but what has
happened is fairly nasty.  I am assuming that you formatted the disks
on the other machine.  Now, there are various flavors of DOS around,
and various flavors of format utilities.  If you take a disk formatted
and written on by dos 3.x and try reading it on a system running dos
2.1x you will have symptoms exactly as described.  MS-DOS is only
upwardly compatable between major releases, i.e. primary number
changes.  There is an additional problem.  We released a new software
package where I work.  Some of our users reported that file
directories were garbaged out and the programs would not work, others
had no problem.  I got a set of bad disks sent back.  On my machine
they were trashed, on a compaq they were trashed, on another machine,
running another flavor of DOS, they were fine.  A perusal with Norton,
revealed the following:

In the FAT table (the File Allocation Table) the first byte used to be
used as a format identifier.  If it was a F0 it marked a single sided
180k floppy.  If it is F8 it is a double sided 360K floppy.  The
format program out on the factory floor was formatting double sided,
but writing the id byte for a single sided disk.  Some versions of dos
make decisions based on the FAT table, others use other criteria to
determine what kind of disk it is.  Those that used other critera,
such as placement of FAT tables worked, the ones that used the id byte
didnot.  MS documentation says that the id byte can no longer be
relied on.  The basic problem is that the first copy of the FAT always
resides at the same spot both for 360k and 180k floppies, but in the
case of a 360k floppy, the fat table is 2 'x as big.  The second
sector of the second fat table, occupies (on a 360K disk) occupies the
exact same physical/logical sector as the directory sector on a 180K
floppy.  This results in total hash in the directory if the system
thinks it's a 180K floppy.

Hope this helps

Cheers

Thus far, the debate has concentrated on the ethics of viruses designed
to `destroy' other viruses. One or two contributors have touched on the
*real* issue but their comments seem to have been lost in the hubbub.

While I'm unfamiliar with other parts of the world, I'm sure you can all
think of non-indigenous (biological) organisms which when released, ran
rampant in their new environment. In Australia, we have many examples:
cane toads, rabbits, blackberries and the prickly-pear cactus spring
immediately to mind.

Since none of you can *guarantee* that you can write software that will
perform without fail on all potential hosts, there is no question. Such
an approach is doomed before it starts. A case in point is SCANV66 (no
offence to John intended - I selected it because most readers will have
read about it recently). Since it wasn't an auto-propagating program we
simply had to note John's bug report and replace it with 66B.

Think about it... and then stop thinking about it. It's a disaster
waiting to happen.

   I agree with Bridget.  In this thread, many responses wandered off onto 
the technical issues, but this was not the point.  In our culture, it is 
not accepted to "help" someone without their informed consent.  And this 
means more than just putting some text and an "OK" button up on a screen 
prior to execution.
   I think that understanding this principle is a real task for younger 
programmers, especially those just entering their full adulthood.  They 
have spent their lives receiving "help" from people without giving 
consent, like parents, teachers, and the like.  They have no way of 
knowing how special a case they were because they were not yet fully 
enabled to give judgement and consent.  It's a new business, all of this, 
about how important it is to get another adult's informed permission 
first, before helping.  Although this understanding will come with time, 
much of the code these days is being written by those who have not yet 
developed this understanding, and who do not have technical supervision 
from those who have.  As a group, our technology may be ahead of our 
personal maturing processes.

Mr. Max Frankel,
Executive Editor
The New York Times
229 West 43rd Street
New York, NY 10036

Dear Mr. Frankel:

Your article, "Washington is Relaxing Its Stand on Guarding
Computer Security", by John Markoff, August 19, reflects a
serious misinterpretation of both the intent and the probable
effect of the new Presidential directive on computer security.

The new directive replaces NSDD #145, which was issued by the
Reagan administration in 1984. With the authority of that older
directive, and because they were not willing to accept the
utterly mundane, unexciting nature of the data security problems
in most agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) distorted
the data security implementations of many federal civil agencies
and reduced the effectiveness of their computer security
programs.

NSA's computer security efforts were oriented exclusively about
the protection of classified data from disclosure to those who
did not have appropriate security clearances. Their development
program did not address the need for data to be complete,
accurate, timely and available. They were concerned only with the
confidentiality of data and wholly unconcerned about their
usefulness to their proper owners.

It has been an unfortunate NSA assumption that those with
appropriate security clearances can be trusted to the level of
their clearances. This ignores the damage which has been done in
recent years by Messrs Walker, Pelton, Pollard, Boyce, Smith,
Miller, et al, all of whom were cleared for access to the data
which they delivered to those who appeared, until recently, to be
the enemy. There seems to be no basis for a belief that
comparable damage has been done through technically-oriented,
foreign-directed penetrations of our systems containing
classified data.

Fortunately, the new directive relieves the civil agencies from a
requirement that they continue to accept misleading guidance in
computer security from NSA. Unfortunately, it was not issued not
until significant damage had already been done.

The Computer Security Act of 1987 gives the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for providing
technical guidance in computer security to the civil agencies and
DoD for the protection of their unclassified data. It is
regrettable that NIST is very poorly funded for work in the
computer security area and, at the current funding levels, cannot
provide any significant amount of the technical leadership in
computer security so badly needed by the civil agencies.

Only a small portion of funds previously available to NSA for
computer security would permit NIST to provide the needed
guidance. Whether those funds are provided or not, the new and
wisely conceived directive will not result in relaxation of the
security afforded data by either DoD or the civil agencies. The
new directive rectifies a serious error of the previous
administration and makes it probable that data security in the
civil agencies will improve - not as much as it would if NIST had
adequate funding and not as much as it should, but it will be
improved. The contrary impression conveyed by your reporter is
unfortunate.

                                     Sincerely,

                                     Robert H. Courtney, Jr.
