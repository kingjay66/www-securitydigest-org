VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Virus experiences in GDR

On June 19-21, 1990, IBM held some kind of a development conference for GDR
universities, in the research center of the ministry for science and technology
in (east) Berlin-Koepenick. Similar to an annual conference for West German
universities (`IBM university forum'), invited speakers from West and East
German universities as well as from IBM informed about their actual work. A
broad diversity of areas was covered, from CD-ROM based 'Thesaurus Linguae
Graecae' to CAD, simulation of complex molecules and synthetic speech. The
conference was accompanied by an exhibition where many additional applications
and software products of scientific interest were shown by East and West German
scientiests as well as IBM people, on IBM owned PS-2s. Many demonstration
diskettes were freely available.

Among the exhibitors, the Virus Test Center demonstrated how to detect and
eradicate viruses. In many discussions, we were surprised to learn that
many scientists regarded viruses as some kind of a joke as they had suffered
mainly from viruses of the funny kind, e.g. playing Yankee Doodle in the Bulga-
rian version "TP 44" or "legalizing marijuana"; only a few seemed to have
experiences in really damaging viruses such as Israeli or Dark Avenger. Yet at
the end of the exposition, our essential task was to eradicate some damaging
viruses such as Dark Avenger (the Bulgarian "Eddie" which broadly migrates
through Eastern Europe) from most of IBM's PS-2 as neither protection
nor careful work had been practized nor prescribed.

With surprise we learned that there existed a secret research unit in GDR
to which every virus or other threat had to be reported; this secret group
would then produce an antivirus and send it to concerned institutions. In its
latest version (which we hope to receive afterwards), 11 viruses could be
detected and eradicated.

Lesson learned: there should be a special antivirus service for exhibitions,
not only for large ones (in FRG's CeBIT and Systems exhibitions, about 15-20%
of the workstations and PCs were found to be infected *at exhibition's end*).

Subject: "Virus" on MS-DOS systems (PC)

We've come across a virus-like problem which seems to primarily
affect floppy disks.   It shows up when you try to format a floppy
and get an error message that says the boot sector is bad.  Attempting
to use the FORMAT command on a pc's hard disk when the system has the
"virus" results in an error message.  (You can do an FDISK -- from
a floppy -- of the hard disk.)

One way the "virus" makes itself known is by creating a file
named delta-character4EIBM.n.n or delta-char<EIBM.n.n  (where n.n
stands for the DOS version with which the diskette was formatted.

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has information on cause and
cure for this virus.   (Our virus detecting software, SCAN v6.3 from
McAfee) can't spot it at all.)

Fridrik Skulason has uploaded his latest version of F-PROT (heavy
package of virus protection utils) to chyde.uwasa.fi (128.214.12.3)
It can be found in pc/virus directory and it is called fprot111.zip

Posting For A Friend Who Cannot Do So------

- -------------------------------------------------------------
We have been hit with a
STONED virus on our hard drive Z-248's.  Unfortunately I
didn't grab any of the stoned info when it was available and
I wondered if you'd post the following for me?

We here at WMU are getting hit with the STONED virus in our
labs.  Please e-mail any info you have on how you have handled
this virus in your labs to:

     kroes@gw.wmich.edu

Thank you.

I appreciate your consideration.  Thank you.

Subject: More info on the "Flipper" virus (Mac)

        Can anyone please give me some more information on the
"Flipper" virus on the Mac?  I have not heard of this virus, and I am
curious to know what it does, where it was found, etc.  All help would
be greatly appreciated.

    HEllo, I am wondering if anyone out on the net has any experience/tech
info regarding ZUC infections.  What does the resource fork of an infected
app look like??  While scanning our servers with SAM 2.0, 2 files from the
Mac tutor sources were listed as being infected in 2/5/88 and 5/24/88
(PopMenus and Color Mixer).  After copying them to a floppy, I scanned with
Sam 2.0 again, Rival 1.1 and Disinfectant 1.8 with no reported infections.
?!*?! HUH?  What gives?  If anyone cares I was in multifinder (I know, I
know) while scanning for the second time.  any clues anyone?

    !-> I survived Southeastern Mass Uuu., 27-JUN-1990

    While scanning our servers, SAM 2.0 reported discovering a "strain of
WDEF".  Upon examination under resedit 2.0a3 the size and code was
completely different from the copy of WDEF A that I have.  Scans with
Disinfectant 1.8 and Rival do not pick this up as a virus.  Paul Cozza,
John Norstadt would you be interested in checking this file out?  It's
binhexed and ready to be sent out.
