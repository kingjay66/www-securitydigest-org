VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Anti-virus viruses

Okay, okay: Saulk/Salk/Sabin---I agree with others who have stated
that the analogy is a stretch; in fact, I think we should drop this
particular line; the analogy is irrelevant.
  Maybe we should drop the entire discussion of anti-virus viruses;
as far as I can tell, some here tend to favor the idea, and some
think it reprehensible, and I don't think anyone has changed anyone
else's opinion...
  Before I drop the subject, though, I would like to rebut
WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL:

You just about lost me, here; I was thinking in terms of "platforms",
rather than differing OS versions.  Still, I disagree: I haven't heard
of any virus which is infectious across platforms (IBM-Mac or anything
else), though I guess "Frankie" is getting close.  Every virus that I
know of is already platform-specific, and I don't see why it shouldn't
be easy to make a virus OS-specific:
  (pseudo code)
     if( os-version != "6.0.5" ) exit;
     infect_it();

Perhaps I'm contributing to this "beating the dead horse"; can we hear
from some of the fence-sitters out there?  Has anyone's mind been
changed during these discussions?

It may also be we're all just getting typing practice: we will see
viruses of this sort, and I think not too long from now. I hope
whoever releases such creates a well-behaved little demon...!

Subject: Sudah ada vaksin (PC)

Mike Lawler quotes Fridrik Skulason in asking the meaning of "sudah
ada vaksin" in Virus-L 3:151.  I missed the original question which
would put it into context, but the language is either Indonesian or
Malay (Bahasa Malaysia) which are almost identical.
    It means "already have (had?) a (the?) vaccine," depending on the
context.
    Mike said it was Arabic to him.  Not bad. :-)  Malay can be
written in Arabic script and is then called Jawi.

Subject: Re: Desktop Manager for WDEF/CDEF (Mac)

      Unfortunately, Desktop Manager will not completely protect you
against CDEF and WDEF.  DM generates its own files (Desktop DB and
Desktop DF) and ignores the old-style Desktop file completely, so if
you delete that (which DM does not do) then there is no Desktop file
for viruses to infect ON YOUR HARD DISK.  However, DM does not change
the way floppy disks manage their desktops, and it doesn't actually
keep the viruses from loading into memory.
      If you were using DM and mounted an infected floppy, those
viruses could not infect your hard disk, but they would load into
memory, where they would remain until you dismounted the floppy.
While in memory, they seek out other Desktop files to infect, so they
could still spread to other floppies or other network volumes.  Even
if the Desktop file on a volume is not being used because of DM, they
can still infect it, and that still causes problems, especially with
AppleShare servers.
      DM is still worth using, but it's not a cure.  As it is, DM is
still officially available only with AppleShare, but Apple really
doesn't care if you use it elsewhere (though they also do not support
such use).  System 7 will adopt a similar scheme for managing desktop
information on hard disks, but like DM, it must leave floppies along
for compatibility.-- Disclaimer: My opinions neither reflect nor
influence those of the NIH, where I have the authority of a small

Subject: 1701 / Help (PC)

Arthur Gutowsky writes that the 1701 indicates a defective sector 0 in
your drive. WRONG !!! This error indicates lack of power, due to a
poor connection, or fluctuating mains supply. The best solution is to
power the machine down and up again. If it does'nt help, open it up
and make sure all cables and cards are tight in place. If that does'nt
help yet, get a technical person to check your power supply and your
disk. Any how, it certainly DOESN'T mean a defective sector on disk,
but rather some defect with the electrical circuicitry.

Enjoy your virus.. It's fun... :-)

Subject: Listing of Indonesian Viruses

     This is the translated version of an article in an Indonesian
     Computer Magazine, as I noted in a posting of VIRUS-L edition
     Friday, August 31, 1990 about mysterious message.  In the
     magazine, also shown the picture of the author of SEMLOHE AND
     KEONGZ virus.  No more information I have instead of this one.

=========================================================================

                        INDONESIAN VIRUS


     * HACKER
       Hacker is come from Bandung, Indonesia.  A rectangle will
     appear from a line and then it will become bigger
     horizontally.  Inside the rectangle, written Bandung and the
     author, Hacker.  There is no damage from this virus.

     * DENZUKO
       With a nice graphic, come from left and right, the
     computer write DENZUKO in the monitor screen.  The author of
     this virus is the same with HACKER.  Those 2 viruses are
     the cause of boot-sector viruses in Indonesia.  No damage
     come from this virus.
       From these viruses come many modification.  Modification
     usually made on the graphics which is uniqe.  And also there
     is a program which will change the graphic DENZUKO into the
     graphics you would like to be.

     * PC CLUB
       With a different technique, without warm-boot (ctrl-alt-
     del), a message will appear every 30 minutes.  To eliminate
     this virus is using SYS command.  No major damage caused by
     this virus.

     * MARDI BROS
       Is a boot-sector virus and appear by warm-boot.  This
     virus made from a University in Jakarta, Indonesia.  There
     may be another version of this virus which will damage hard-
     disk.

     * AREMA
       This virus is come from Malang, Indonesia.  AREMA is an
     abbreviation of "Arek-Arek Malang" or in English mean
     "People of Malang."  No clear idea who made this virus, but
     it seems that this virus is a modification of DENZUKO.

     * SEMLOHE and KEONGZ
       This virus once grow very fast in East Java, Indonesia.
     The author, Sigit Wasista, live in Surabaya, Indonesia said
     that this virus made only for experiment only.  After there
     are CBrain, Hacker, and Denzuko viruses, Sigit tried to view
     and analyize those viruses and add background song when the
     viruses come and finally SEMLOHE AND KEONGZ created.

     * PC MONSTAR
       PC MONSTAR virus made by Handiyanto, a student of one
     University in Indonesia in computer major.  TOETOE RULIANDA
     also from one University in Indonesia with the same major.
     This virus grow in East Java, and it has the same style and
     appearnace looks like Denzuko

     * ROBERT/NARWIN
       This virus using the same method as PC CLUB.  But it is
     using graphics instead of text.  The letters that appear
     looks like Japanese character (Katakana), so it is called
     Japan Virus

     * SUPERNOVA
       The author Fen Tjin, a student from a university in
     Jakarta, Indonesia.  This is the first local virus that made
     some damages, reformat the diskette.  This virus will
     format the diskette when there is instruction to print to
     the printer.  And there will be message in the printer, and
     then it stop.

     * FREDDY
       Freddy was made by one of a student in a academy of
     computer in Indonesia.  It infected the program, not a boot
     sector virus.  The program infected is IBMBIO.COM
       The characteristic of this virus is the appearance of
     FREDDY in a box.

     * AMOEBA
       This is a .COM and .EXE virus.  This virus infect when
     using disk access, such as copy, dir, etc.
       When "DIR" command is instructed, the virus will search
     for COMMAND.COM and if that file is free of virus, it will
     infect.
       When it is active, it will appear a message "SMA KHETAPUNK
     - NOUVEL Band A.M.O.E.B.A. by PrimeSoft Inc."  This message
     only appear on CGA.  "SMA KHETAPHUNK" is an Indonesian
     Senior High School, the name of the school is "SMA
     KETAPANG."

     * MYSTIK
       This virus will infect .EXE and .COM file.  To find out if
     a file is infected, we can use "TYPE" command to one of the
     file that is suspected.  If we did it, the message "- MYSTIC
     - COPYRIGHT (C) 1989 - 2000 by SsAsMsUsEsL"
       This is a new virus and there is no vaccine.  The author,
     Samuel, this year, he just graduated from Senior High
     School.  He is working in one of the center of Computer
     business in Jakarta, Indonesia.

No you don't.  1701 is an internal diagnostic error message.  It means
hard disk controller failure.  Generaly, it is caused by a dead hard
disk.  open the case up, and check all the controller cables.  Next
power the system up, while holding a pencil or screwdriver against the
hard disk case and the other end pressed into your ear (it makes it
easier to hear if the hard disk is spinning up.)  If you don't detect
that the hd is spinning up, then you probably have a bad hdisk,
(generaly it is the controller board on the bottom of the hard disk).
It it spins up, then it may be the disk controller card it's self.

This is a good argument against refering to viruses by numbers.  This
individual has confused a virus number with an error message.

Subject: Will the real LHarc please stand up?

What is the current valid version of the LHarc archiver?  I have found
two different ones which claim to be it, and I have also heard
warnings about versions labelled 1.14 being bogus.

I received two versions.  The first was uploaded to my BBS:

     LH113DE  COM    36575   5-14-90   9:18p

and this is from SIMTEL20, uploaded in July:

     LH114B   COM    36204   8-29-90  12:59a


When I unpacked the first, it displayed a title screen:

>LHarc's SFX 1.13S (c)Yoshi, 1989.
>LHarc v1.13d                                                Jan 15, 1990

Note where it says "this is perhaps the final version of LHarc v1.1xx
series".  The title in the documentation file says:

>      User's Manual for High-Performance File-Compression Program
>
>                          LHarc Version 1.13d

>
>           Copyright (c) Haruyasu Yoshizaki (Yoshi), 1988-90

and the revision history says:

>LHarc User's Manual                                              page 22

Contrast this with the title in the documentation for version '1.14 beta':

>      User's Manual for High-Performance File-Compression Program
>
>                           LHARC  Version 1.14a

>
>           Copyright (c) Haruyasu Yoshizaki (Yoshi), 1988-89

Note that version '1.14b' predates '1.13d' by about 5 months.  The revision
history for '1.14b' is:

> LHARC  User's Manual                                              page 22

No mention whatsoever of version '1.13d'!!

One or the other of these, possibly both, is bogus.  SCANV v66 did not
detect any viruses in either executable or archive.

Thanks for any help you can provide on this.

Then *WHY* is it that I almost NEVER see any virus signature mentioned
here in comp.virus? If that would be the case I could fairly easily
update my virus scanner by just reading this group carefully (I don't
now how to download signature files from any bbs, although it seems to
be possible from the site where I work). If there are new virusses
analyzed, could there *please* be posted a signature to this group
including info like name, length and BOOT/EXE/COM infection? Thanks.

Subject: Dutch Intermediar mentions "Benign viruses"

In the latest issue of the Dutch weekly "Intermediar" I found an
article that shocked me.  It told about a virus that was made to
"update" databases that contained peoples' addresses and such.  The
author claimed that it was convenient to have up-to-date databases
that were maintained this way.  He used as an example that "If you
look for people interested in a certain subject, you may find only two
people if you search on Monday, and already six if you look on
Wednesday."

I find it frightening that somebody finds this kind of viruses a good
thing, while we know that every idiot can change those programs to
very nasty harmful objects.

He mentioned that a virus doing this was developed to "update"
HyperCard databases.  So Mac users, look out for this guy!

It's just a warning.  There are people who believe in "good" viruses.

"Does the text 'Sudah ada vaksin' mean anything in language?"

A short quote like that is similar to the Rosarch <sp?> ink blot test.
One can read different things into it. As one person said, it could be
for "I should have had a vaccine." From my knowledge of Latvian, the
quote looks like a scatalogical reference to vaccines, something
roughly translated as "Excrement upon vaccine". But the quote is not
Latvian. It may be another language of Eastern Europe, perhaps
Lithuanian or Polish.  Again, the quote is much too short and I am am
an ameteur linguist.

As for the question about the word "KONIEC" meaning anything, perhaps
it is a Eastern European (Slavic, perhaps) derivation of the German
word "Koenig" (can't render an umlaut here) meaning "King" ,
"Monarch".

I hope this may provide clues to answer the question.
