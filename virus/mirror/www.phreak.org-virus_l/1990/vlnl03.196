VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Although I agree with all of the above, I would like to try to
illuminate this issue from a different perspective. Two additional,
serious problems arise from choosing a "disinfection" approach instead
of restoring from backups:

1- It tends to encourage poor computing practice by advancing the
misperception that diligent and orderly backup and restoral procedures
are not necessary.

2- It damages the accountability of the software vendor. If the
software has a bug that causes problems for the user, the vendor will
be able to dodge responsibility and place the burden of proof on the
user if he can demonstrate that the software was modified by the
disinfection process. A simple checksum test will reveal modification
and place the presumption of blame on the user.

Restoration from known good backups always works. It is consistent with
good computing practice. And it does not complicate the issue of
responsibility.

Subject: Possible Virus in TAME (PC)

There could be a possible virus in the Shareware program TAME (a multi tasking
aid for Windows, Desqview etc.)  I was unable to detect any virus using SCAN
V67C or VET 6.1, however since using this program some friends have noticed
*   Divide by zero error every time MS-Windows starts up
*   Reinstalling Windows does not help
*   Removing all traces of TAME does not help
*   Deleting and reinstalling Windows still does not help
*   Scan & Vet do not detect it
*   "Virus" did not attack immediately
*   Other friend's PCs who used similar shareware except for TAME did not have
any problems

I am not saying that this is a Windows virus because I do not have enough
information.  Could someone please check out TAME (available on
circa.circa.indiana or monu6.cc.monash.edua.au) and either confirm or deny the
existance of a virus.)

On November 16, A colleague and I found a strain of the Jerusalem B
virus (at least that's what virusscan said it was) which upon being
cleaned locks the machine and trashes the disk.  It also seems to
survive a warm boot.  Can anyone explain why or send me any
information on how to deal with this mutation?  I would appreciate the
help.  I am currently doing research on viruses for a class of mine.
Thanks.

[on running software from zip files]
   One problem, however, is that you cannot zip COMMAND.COM, so you would
   have to boot from a write-protected floppy, and insert the system disk
   as needed.

I've wondered why DOS-on-ROM has never been a big hit in Europe.
When I was in the US last June, I was sold a PC/AT that I only afterwards
realized had DOS 3.31 (supports 32M+ partitions) on ROM.  I mean, they
didn't even bother to advertise this feature separately.
Of course updates are a bit more difficult, but I think the added speed and
security compensate quite well.
(In case you are wondering, it had BIOS support for reading CONFIG/AUTOEXEC
from the hard disk instead from the ROM :-)

Subject: WDEF-A Response (Mac)

I would like to comment on Mr. Ed Murphy's comment that -
"You can get rid of virus by rebuilding the Desktop on your
hard disk (which is where it resides)."

I also had problems with WDEF A on my MAC SE with 100mb Jasmine
backpack hard drive.  After following several messages I contacted <
coherent!dplatt@ames.arc.nasa.gov (Dave Platt) > and he advised me to
reboot with a "clean" boot disk then run Disinfectant on the System
folder on the hard disk.  I then installed Disinfectant Protection and
now I know my hard disk is clean.  This also immediately notifies me
about a possible WDEF infection on any floppy I open.

I'm fairly new to the Mac side of the house but with my short
experience I discovered that rebuilding the Desktop did not
rid my hard disk of the WDEF virus.  To my surprise I discovered
that Norton Disk Dr. and SAM both notified me of a possible virus
however, they did not completely eradicate it from the System folder.
Maybe if I'd have booted from a virus free disk, then ran
Norton Disk Dr. or SAM I would have had the same results
as with Disinfectant.

Please be careful with your very broad statement of "You can get rid
of virus by rebuilding the Desktop on your
hard disk (which is where it resides)."

>Can the hard-disk be written without use of BIOS int 13? (We have XT & ATs)

Yes, in numerous ways - many Bulgarian viruses do this, by the use of
an obscure INT 2FH function, which enables them to bypass any program
monitoring INT 13H.

Other viruses do this by a direct JMP into ROM.

In the case of boot sector viruses, any 13H monitoring program is
useless, because the virus gains control of INT 13, before the
monitoring program is executed.

  LZEXE really is a nice program, but the part about virus detection
is misleading at best.  If a virus infects an executable *after* it
has been LZEXE-compressed, then this should get detected by LZEXE's
CRC check.  (Actually, even this part is no longer correct since this
check was apparently removed in Ver. 0.91 of LZEXE.)  But the CRC
check doesn't help in the least if the file was infected *before*
compression.  In fact, compression makes matters *worse* in this case
since most programs which scan files for known viruses will not detect
them within a compressed file.  (A few anti-viral programs, such as
McAfee's SCAN and Skulason's F-FCHK have been modified to recognize
known viruses within LZEXE-compressed files.  Unfortunately, this
doesn't help against other methods of executable compression, e.g.
Microsoft's EXEPACK.)

Does anyone know of a WordPerfect virus that the document duplicates
itself within the document and if you try to go to the end of the
document it takes a very long time and then goes to the top of the
document...I have seen this happen 3 times to 3 people in the last
couple of days and was wondering if such a virus exists?

I need help NOW!  Samford University has been struck by the Ping Pong B
virus, and I need help.

Please tell me what you know about the symptoms, damaging effects, and
cures for Ping Pong B.  It is the last week of class and we estimate that
5,000 papers are due THIS WEEK that our students will be using lab PCs to
produce.

Rob Slade writes:

One can only use the -AV option when PKzip is registered.
When you do, you can specify the string that is to be displayed
when someone unzips an archive created with your registered PKzip.

The message is encrypted into the zip-file.  And can only be decrypted
correctly if the archive is in identical state (unmodified in any way).

That means, if you know what message normally should be displayed by
PKunzip when you unzip an zip-file from a particular vendor, you're
safe.

[Ed. Sounds (to me) to be at least a rudimentary public key system of
sorts.  Does anyone know how cryptographically sound this option is?
Also, I assume that PK is maintaining the database of developers'
signatures; could someone please post info on how a developer goes
about getting registered?

Making the (rather broad) assumption that the system is
cryptographically secure and that it's not prohibitive for vendors
(big and small) to register, this seems (in my opinion) to be a great
service that PK is providing - at least to users in the U.S.  For what
that's worth...]

	I called the number you mentioned and found two

	and CLEANP71B.. also, the 71 versions are now
	already "old"..

[Ed. This is true.  I called McAfee Associates and was told that

Perhaps this could be part of the next VSUMmary file, or a new section
in the monthly archives list.

[Ed. Good idea - though I'd vote for it to be in the
VIRUS-L/comp.virus archives, so that there are no $ licensing
restrictions on its distribution (VSUM is a shareware document!).  I
have placed Frisk's article on cert.sei.cmu.edu for anonymous FTP (we
hope to have a mail-based archive server on-line in the near future).
