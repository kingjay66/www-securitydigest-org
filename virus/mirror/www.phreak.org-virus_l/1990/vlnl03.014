VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed

Subject: New York Times on the Morris Trial

William Murray recently asked where John Markoff was when we needed
coverage of the Morris trial.  Thirty minutes later I read a lengthy
article in the Arizona Republic attributed to the New York Times.  I
am including in quotations only those items which I have not seen
previously on Virus-L or Risks Forum.  These are direct quotes which I
have not independently verified for their accuracy.

"Indeed, Morris' lawyer said that to show his client as a proponent of
safeguarding computer security, he will introduce as evidence a videotape
that shows the defendant giving a lecture at the National Security Agency
in 1987 on how to gain access to computers illicitly."

"But in its case against Morris, the prosecution also plans to use the
videotape."

"The videotape of Morris's lecture at the National Security Agency came
to light recently when Morris' lawyer filed legal papers to introduce
classified material at the trial related to the film."

"The lecture, which was not classified, was presented at the security
agency at the request of the defendant's father, Robert Morris, the
chief scientist of the agency and an internationally know computer-
security (sic) expert."

"The younger Morris' lawyer, Thomas A. Guidoboni, said the circumstances
surrounding the lecture and a similar talk that Morris gave at the Naval
Research Laboratory the same year are significant in that they create a
view of Morris as someone who has acted responsibly on computer-security
issues."

"But Guidoboni also said that seen in isolation, without an explanation of
the circumstances, the tape could harm Morris' case."

"The elder Morris has told lawyers that describing the subject of the
lecture and the makeup of the audience, as the defense wants to do,
would require the disclosure of classified information, which he said he
would not do."

"The issue of whether classified data will be used at the trial has not
been resolved."

Without intending to minimize the threat of vandals, the damage that
they do is vanishingly small when compared to errors by the
well-intentioned.  The danger to which this mechanism was addressed
was the accidental and unwitting contamination of a distribution
diskette.  It was not intended to protect against the less likely
vandalism.

Much of the discussion of the "shrink wrap" issue is focused on the
inability of the purchaser to determine if the disk has ever been
used and rewrapped.

In my opinion, a solution to this problem is for the software
publishers to use disks that are permanently write-protected.  (ie; no
notch on 5.25" disks and a hole without slider on 3.5" disks).  This
will not stop a determined terrorist from infecting disks, but it will
stop the casual accidental infection of purchased software.

Stores that offer return policies are exactly the ones with whom I do
deal, since it is almost impossible to see if the software will meet
my needs by reading the box or trying out the store demonstration
copy.  What they should do is to be more careful when accepting the
returned items (check for missing materials, and check for infection
of the disks) before returning the person's money.

Assuming, of course, that the store has another copy on the shelf.
This would also waste a lot of time reshrink wrapping software.

Assuming, of course, that the store has the computer that the software
is for.  At the store I work at, we carry IBM, Mac, and Apple, but we
only have an IBM computer.  Also, the store may only have 5.25 drives
and the software in question is on 3.5 disks.  The computers are also
used for demo software in case someone wants to see it run before they
but it.  Checking every disk

I agree that something should be done, but this isn't the answer for
everyone.

Subject: Internet Worm Creator goes to trial

I suppose that all the computer community have already judged the
worm creator in discussions around the world, so it is fair
to make a jury of "non-computer" people.

My point is, this trial don't eliminates the necessity of a
ethical judgement. Maybe what he did is not a crime, but is clearly
a violation of ethical aspects of computer use.

I suggest that a ethical code, similar to the ethical code in
medicine should be developed. I suppose that ACM has one, but is not
the same. ACM  didn't control the exercise of the computer activities.

Subject: Re: Shrink wrap...still safe?


Several writers have suggested that vendors distribute software
on 5.25" diskettes without write-enable notches since evidence of
tampering with such diskettes is fairly obvious.

A sheet-metal notching tool cuts a very clean write-enable notch
which can fool many users.  Thus, I would suggest that vendors
distributing software on diskettes without write-enable notches
also add a warning ON THE DISKETTE LABEL stating that the diskette
was manufactured without a write-enable notch and that the buyer
should reject any diskette with a write enable notch cut in it.

I'm not surprised that the jurors are technically incompetant; people
who have any competence in the field at issue are regularily excluded
from juries, usually by the defense though.  In drug trials, the defense
as a matter of course tries to go for as stupid a jury as possible as
they 1) are less likely to understand why the defendant is guilty and
2) are less likely to acquit.

Look at it this way; if you or I or any of the readers of this newsgroup
were on the jury, our technical knowledge would give us an "advantage"
over the other jurors which we could use to sway them to support our
position.

Juries are not totally to blame for insane verdicts and awards; part of
the blame must be put on the system that tends to impanel incompetant
juries.  In my circle of admittedly bright and educated friends, not
a single one has, to my knowledge, ever been accepted for jury duty.

We need assistance in eliminating the Pakistan C-Brain virus from our
IBM PCs and compatibles.  The virus has infected virtually all of our
PCs located in our microcomputer center, which is an open lab on
campus.

Any information that anyone can provide will be most beneficial.

        One of the most frightening experiences of my life was being
called to jury duty.  I got to see what a 'jury of my peers' would
consist of.  It gives one a lot of incentive not to get caught. (:-)

IANAL, but I see a problem in the future with technology-related
litigation.  What good is the right to have your case tried before
a jury of idiots?  For example, consider Intel v. NEC or Apple v.
MS & HP.  It's hard enough explaining the concepts involved to a
reasonably intelligent judge, but a jury picked because they didn't
know anything?

I suppose that if a jury of people from Washington, DC can be found
who never heard of Ollie North, I suppose there's a jury for all of
us...  (:-)

[Ed. Forwarded from comp.sys.ibm.pc]

Apparently, we have run across our first real virus.  As of now, it's not
fully know what this can do or even what program is doing it but here's
a description of a file that keeps on appearing on our systems...

The file name is '800' and appears in the root directory.  File size is
368K and contained in the file are text strings that contain copyright messages
for Compac Computer Corp. (no, our systems are from another manufacturer).
Twords the bottom of the file, it appears to have a questionaire pertaining to
animal laboratory research.

If anyone else knows *anything* about this, please post it...
