VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: WP Virus?! (PC)

I have seen several mentions of possible virii on WordPerfect.  Let me
add my two cents...

The problem with several copies of the same document within a
document, with correspondingly long times to move the cursor around,
is not at all virus related.  It's simply a case of the user
retrieving the document into itself on several occasions.  It's
especially common if a document starts with a centered page title.
Users see the blank screen and think they have to retrieve again
because it didn't work.  In fact, all they had to do was move the
cursor down and they would have seen their text.  Simple user error;
it happens all the time here.

We have also had our share of trashed disks and documents, and I have
to agree with the people who observed that this happens if you change
disks in the middle of something.  We've deduced it to be one of
several side effects.  First, inserting a disk into a machine already
in WordPerfect results in WP thinking that its temporary files have
certain names and are in certain places.  Using the system then
essentially writes over spaces on the disk that WP thinks are
available, leading to the cross-linked files appearance.  Second, on
large documents when WP has not been exited, the overflow files often
will contain text which ends up in the midst of the document belonging
to the second student to sit down at the machine.  These problems can
be greatly minimized by simply refraining from inserting your disk
into a system on which WP is running.  We stress that students should
reboot in such cases, but of course they rarely do.  Hence the
grateful appreciation of Norton Utilities :^)

Subject: serious epidemic of wp problems (PC)

hello all:
     i could really use some help here on this one.  there are a
number of students here (>20) that are experiencing the same problem
with wordperfect.
     i will list the symptoms as they happen chronologically:

an * before a line means that some have had this happen...

*1. scan picks up a stoned infection on a floppy
 2. students begin to have odd printing problems with wp
    - extra pages inserted into text
    - printout has top of first page, bottom of last page,
      and then parts of the body
 3. students have editing trouble with wordperfect where a document
    is doubled or parts of it are appended to the end of itself.
 4. when a directory search is performed on the disk there are some
    very strange and unwanted files (some of zero length).
    - one of these is joke.dbf
    - another (always appearing at the end of the directory listing)
      is "***ibm  3.1" as seen with the period in the text
      the *** are garphics characters.
 5. a look at the boot sector of these disks shows a very warped
    number of sectors per cluster and a very strange number of dir
    sectors.  trying to look at the end of the dir sector with norton
    ended with a very abrupt system crash. (could be a clever one)
 6. the .dfb file is not in dbase format

the administration here has given me a copy of one *possibly*
infectious disk. we are unsure as of yet whether this is a virus
problem.  i have heard some talk of a wordperfect-specific virus, but
i am not in the position to speculate.
     i am not representing my school when i ask these questions. any
statements made by me are not to be construed as an official statement
of the school.
     if anyone has seen something like this or can explain any of
these symptoms, please mail to me directly.  i have quite a collection
of the known viruses as samples and none of the almost fifty of them
match or even resemble what i have been able to find on the disk.  i
am also unaware of any virus exhibiting these symptoms.  if you have
any comments, witt, or suggestions, please send to me...

thanx in advance...

I had the same experience with WP virus.  We are using floppy disks
for Word Perfect 5.0 (2 disks needed).  And if we put patron's disk in
drive b, the WP system #1 in drive a, the contents in drive b will be
gone.  There are many other problems, such as the patron's current
file is lost while editing it.  They did not do anything except typing
it.  Does any body know any solution ?

  I think reports of viri which survive warm reboots are caused by
misunderstanding the viri and/or the viri scanners.

  The essential parts in the above text are "stays in memory" (true) and
"survives warm boots" (false).

  I had Jerusalem B on my PC and when warm booting from a clean floppy
and running McAfee's SCAN from that floppy, SCAN indeed says that
Jerusalem B is in memory. However because of the warm boot the virus
can not *execute* anymore. Often if you first skip SCAN's scan of
memory (i.e. no /M), memory will be "cleared" (i.e. overwritten with
SCAN's data space) and a subsequent SCAN /M will not say that
Jerusalem B is in memory (because it isn't anymore).

  Perhaps virus scanners should include an option or a seperate
program which can be used to clear all of memory after a virus has
been found in memory, so this class of false alarms can be eliminated.

Subject: Re: *NIX virus... necessary knowledge. (UNIX)

David.M.Chess writes that a UNIX virus simply has to find executable
files to write to and infect them, and does not need any special
privileges.

Even if there were a substantial number of such executable files, there
is another consideration:

There are many different types of machines running different types of
UNIX.  For this reason it is very unlikely that a UNIX virus could
ever become as widespread as an IBM/MS-DOS virus, for example.  As
soon as it arrived at a machine with a different CPU (or even the same
CPU with a different executable file format) its propagation at that
point would be blocked.

Subject: Stoned Again!! (PC)

I was doing some quick work for my mom last night when SUBST said
Error in EXE file.  The last time I saw this was during that fun
little Stoned incident.  So I pulled out SCAN and sure enough, the
sucker was back.  It turns out that it was on my mom's Professional
Write disk.  So I think I know where I got it originally now.  This
time I think I got away with no data damage because I found Stoned
quickly and ran SCAN, Norton Disk Doctor, and *then* CHKDSK.  I think
it was a mistake last time to run CHKDSK first because the FAT was
screwed up.  By letting NDD take care of it first, I didn't have any
lost clusters.

Both types of requests, requests for Unix utilities which search
MS-DOS files for viruses, and requests for utilties/information
related to Unix viruses, appeared in recent issues of this list.

Subject: Stoned virus info needed (PC)

A colleague with an EPson PC running DOS could not boot his machine
this morning but got instead a message that said "Your machine is now
stoned". By searching through past articles in this newsgroup I found
reference to the "Stoned virus". The name suggests that this is what
my friend has. I am not an IBM PC expert, so am not familiar with the
viruses in the PC world. I would be most grateful if someone could
email me information about whether this is indeed the virus we have
and, if so, how to eradicate it and how to test other machines for the
virus.

Any suggestions on appropriate software to use would also be
appreciated. I will try to access the archives at SIMTEL and see
what software I can find there.

Thank you very much.

Hello there. I am one of the people at MIT who helped trap the little

What does this mean??  STONED (as we keep saying) is a boot-sector
infector.  If you mean that these machines were *booted* from a
non-tested disk, and it infected the machines with a boot-sector
virus, then thanks for the warning.  (Also, it may seem callous, but
it serves you right.)

If you mean that you ran the demo program from the disks without
re-booting then you obviously haven't been reading the digest/group
for a couple of weeks.  If you ran the demo program and *subsequently*
found that your PC's were STONED, then you didn't get the infection
off the demo disk - your PC's were already infected and running the
demo's was enough for the demo disks to become infected.  If this is
what happened then thanks for nothing - you are just increasing the
hysteria.  Also, you should read Hoffman's Virus Summary List, or the
documentation that comes with the popular virus scanning/disinfecting
programs to get a better understanding of how certain virii work.  You
cannot get a boot-sector infector virus fron running an executable
(possibility of trojan "implanting" prog excepted - none known of).

You wouldn't do this anyway??  There is no such thing as being too
careful.  We just received a couple of software updates from
"reputable" vendors.  First thing we did was run them through our
virus scanners.

One doesn't need root privs.  One doesn't need to know the internals
of UNIX.

I doubt a virus that works on a particular UNIX cpu would be much more
or less complicated than one that works on a pc.

There are some very sophisticated viruses on pc's and I admit that
there could be even more sophisticated viruses in UNIX that would be
very complicated, but a very simple "UNIX" virus (using no holes)
would not be difficult to write.  Simple viruses on pc's have spread
uncontrollably.

>No one but root can mess with my files or directories, I and I should

Not true.  You can mess with your files.  Similarly, on a PC.

>If you keep people from writing to */bin directories,
>they will not be able to mess with publicly used utilities.

True, but:

 1) Viruses don't need to be in publicly used utilities (the */bin
    directories) to spread.

 2) Someone needs access to these directories, or your software will
    never change.  When this person (with root priv) executes a program
    with a (simple) virus in it, those public utilities will get infected
    anyway.

Viruses spread when people share software.  On pc's this can be done
through removable disks.  On time-share systems, it is easier.  You
can simply assign execute access on a file to a friend and let him/her
know about the program.  There are many other ways to share software
on both types of systems, but it is generaly easier on time-share
systems.

Subject: New features of VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP (PC)

Here is a summary of the new features of Version 72 of McAfee
Associates VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP programs (all holds true for
NETSCAN and VSHIELD as well):


VIRUSCAN

     Version 72 of VIRUSCAN adds four new viruses and improves the
external virus data handling capabilities.
     The ZeroHunt virus was uploaded to Homebase BBS by Paul Ferguson
of Washington, D.C., USA.  It is a memory-resident infector that
attaches itself to the stack space in .COM files.  Since the virus is
attaching itself inside a file, as opposed to adding itself to the
beginning or end, the size of the file will not change.
     The Bloody! virus has been reported in Massachusetts, USA as well
as Taiwan and Europe.  It infects the boot sector of a floppy disk and
the partition table of the hard disk.  After approximately 128
reboots, the virus displays the message "Bloody! Jun. 4, 1989" which
is the date of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in Beijing, China.
     The Jeff virus is a .COM file infector that destroys data by
writing garbage to the hard disk.  It contains the text "Jeff is
visiting your hard disk."
     The Music Bug virus has been reported in Woodland Hills,

     Version 72 of CLEAN-UP adds the removal of two new viruses, the
Liberty virus, widely being reported in Australia and the southeastern
United States, and the Plastique virus, which is being reported in the
United States, Asia, Australia, and Europe.  Additionally, handling of

AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION OF .ZIP FILES

     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file is unzipped and
receive the message "Authentic Files Verified!  # NWN405 Zip Source:
McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files then do not run them.  If
your version of PKUNZIP does not have verification ability, then this
message may not be displayed.  Please contact McAfee Associates if
your .ZIP file has been tampered with.

That's it.  The next release is scheduled for the first week or so of
February.
