Yep, the 4096 is easily detectable in memory.   I think the main
cause for worry has been the feeling that there are lots of
people out there who don't use virus scanners, and whose main
hope of noticing an infection is noticing file lengths (or
contents) changing, or programs malfunctioning.   A "stealth"
style virus with few bugs will tend to be less noticeable by
those means than a non-stealthy one.
  I definitely agree, though, that for users who have a good
virus-scanning program, the 4096 is no more worrisome than
a comparable non-stealthy virus would be.

P.S. Detecting a virus in memory is a little more prone to
     false alarms than detecting one in files, because after
     an infected system has been cleaned up the virus
     signature may still make it into memory, because it
     is still in the "cluster gas" somewhere on the disk,
     and may get loaded into unused parts of disk buffers
     or whatever.

Subject: postscript trojan

          A few days ago there was a series of messages about a laser
writer trojan horse that set the password to some unknown value.
          A fix was also posted. (a program that could reset the
password without knowing the old one.)
          Noone said what the name of the trojan horse was, or what it
claimed to be good for. Does anyone know?
          The fix included the caveat that it would probably fail on
postscript clones.
          Ok. We have a kyocera Q8010 that has apparently been hit. Or
some bright reader of comp.virus suddenly realised printers have
passwords and just sent down the commands to change it from 0 to
whatever.
          Yes, the fix failed on this clone. I am in contact with
Kyocera, but I am not sure they will be able to help. I fear they will
say you can't reset passwords without knowing the old one.
          It occurs to me that maybe the fix program fails because the
password is in a different spot in the eprom.
          Any ideas? Specifically woud the authors of the fix routines
be interested in adapting them to this printer if I could get them
technical info like the location of the password?
          Anyone agree with me that maybe the password should be in cmos
so we could open the case and yank the battery? Not that agreeing with
me will do much good - but I'd feel better.

And even that does not guard you against the virus/trojan Ken Thompson
described in his Turing award lecture.
How can you guarantee that the compiler/assembler or linker does not
insert some extra code, recognizing the fact that it is
compiling/assembling/linking the new version of the compiler, operating
system or whatever?

Therefore I do not agree with mr. Lathieyre: It is better to have one
source of your O/S. I'd rather boot off one of the suppliers disks than
off on I built myself using God knows what utilities...

Subject: Disk Manager (PC)

  Michael Greve wrote that his machines have become infected with the
4096 even though the hard disks are protected with Disk Manager.
Several people reacted by saying that Disk Manager is disk partition-
ing software, not anti-viral software.

  Well, I don't think Michael is that far off.  True, Disk Manager is
disk partitioning software.  But it includes an option to make a par-
tition READ-ONLY.  In principle, this should prevent infection of any
file on such a partition.  Of course, since this is only software pro-
tection, it can probably be circumvented.  But I think that it should
be effective against all current file viruses, including the 4096.
So if this option has actually been used on one of the partitions,
files *on that partition* should be protected against the 4096.

  Note that I said that it should be effective against *file* viruses.
I don't recall if it's possible, under Disk Manager, to arrange for
the boot sector to be in the read-only partition.  If it is, then this
should also work against ordinary boot-sector viruses.  However, it
won't work against partition-record viruses, like the Stoned (= Mari-
juana) and EDV.

The virus "disappears during the checksum process" only in the sense
that files infected by this virus do not appear to have been altered
*IF THE VIRUS IS IN MEMORY WHEN CHECKSUMMING IS PERFORMED*.  Didn't
Dr. Highland mention this in his article?  The same is true of some
other viruses, incl. EDV and Number of the Beast (V512).  From this it
is obvious that the answer to your question  whether it avoids *all*
checksum algorithms  is affirmative.  But this is only under the above
circumstances.

  The remedy is obvious: Instead of performing checksumming from your
hard disk, do it only after cold booting from your original (write-
protected) DOS diskette, with the checksum program and database also
on a diskette.  This will ensure that RAM is uninfected when the check-
sum program is run.  (At least it's much surer than depending on checks
such as those advocated by Jim Molini and Chris Ruhl on this forum
several months ago.)

Subject: Re: F-PROT experience (PC)

  Sigurd Andersen asks for opinions on F-PROT.  In my opinion, this
package of 21 utilities includes some excellent programs.  I'll des-
cribe only a few of them:
  F-DRIVER is a small device driver which (1) checks RAM for boot-sec-
tor and partition-record viruses when it is initially activated and
(2) checks each program which is about to be executed to see if it
contains a known file virus.  If so, it stops execution.
  F-LOCK is a RAM-resident program which monitors suspicious activi-
ties.  It is effective not only against known viruses but also against
Trojans and unknown viruses.  In this respect, it resembles FluShot+.
However, it is designed to stop even viruses which write to the disk
by jumping directly to an interrupt handler instead of diverting
interrupt vectors in the normal way.  In practice, this does not work
on all such viruses (e.g. it does not seem to be effective against
the 4096), but since the idea behind the prevention of such viruses
seems to be sound, it's possible that this is just a bug which will
soon be removed.
  F-DISINF scans boot sectors and partition records for known viruses
and optionally removes them.
  F-FCHK scans files for known viruses and new mutations of them and
can cure such files in almost all cases.
  F-SYSCHK scans memory for known viruses.
  F-MMAP displays a map of memory.  It includes memory blocks which
other such utilities do not show (e.g. those near the TOM, where most
boot-sector viruses hide, and I think even those above the 640K mark).

  What I *don't* like in the package are the "self-checking" programs.
I think there are better ways of achieving the same thing.  But, of
course, you don't have to use everything in the package.

  The prices for F-PROT are as follows:

>      Educational institutions:   1-14  computers     $15
>                                  15-500 computers    $1 per computer
>                                  over 500 computers  $500
>
>      Everybody else:             1-7 computers       $15
>                                  8-500 computers     $2 per computer
>                                  over 500 computers  $1000

  F-DRIVER corresponds (approx.) to McAfee's VSHIELD, while F-DISINF
and F-FCHK do the equivalent of McAfee's SCAN and CLEAN (on almost the
same number of viruses).  Prior to Ver. 1.11, F-FCHK was quite slow.
But its speed has since been improved.  It still takes about 50% more
time than SCAN, but it can probably detect more mutations of known vi-
ruses since it uses 2 or 3 identifying strings for almost every virus.

This is a forward from Aryeh Goretsky of the Computer Virus
Industry Association:
================================================================

Note:  Contact information from the following CVIA Membership Alert
has been removed from the posting, but has been submitted
separately to the Virus-L moderator.

August 8, 1990
CVIA Membership Alert
Originating Members:  [Information Removed]
Alert Type:  Initial Infection Spread
Library Entries:  Joshi; 4096
Entry Types:  "Stealth"; Boot infectors; File Infectors

          A widespread outbreak of the Joshi virus has been reported in
the Detroit area.  More than two dozen computer stores, small
businesses and individual users have reported infections within the
past three days.  The virus is the "A" variety.  The transmission
vector into the Detroit area has not yet been determined, although
some signs point to a national computer store chain.  Many of the
local retail outlets of this national chain have reported
infections.
          This virus is spreading more rapidly than any previous virus
that has been tracked by this organization.   As a point of
comparison, the Sunday virus (a relatively fast replicator) was in
the public domain (U.S.) for more than eight months before it
reached a point of consistent multiple daily reports.  The Dark
Avenger followed a similar course.  The Joshi virus has been in the
U.S. public domain for less than 45 days, and we are currently
receiving more reports of this virus per day than for the Sunday
and Dark Avenger combined.  We cannot account for this anomaly.
Perhaps it has something to do with being the first known "Stealth"
partition table infector, or perhaps with an opportunistic event
such as the high volume distribution of infected diskettes or
hardware.  In any case and alert is in order.  An interim remover
for the Joshi is available to liaison persons in the event an
infection is detected.

          An August seventh report of the 4096 virus in Vermont marks
the first CVIA reported occurrence of this virus in New England.
 We are continuing to receive multiple daily reports of this virus
from geographic areas previously reported as affected.

Subject: Bouncing ball? (PC)

Starting around the beginning of May, our office's IBM/PCs began
showing a strange thing on their screens:  A "bouncing ball" type of
graphic which floats around the screen, bouncing off the boundaries.
The ball appears when I'm in DOS, and disappears when an application
is run.  It's not there all the time, and I don't know what triggers
its appearance.  Anyway, what I'm getting at is:

1) Has anyone else come across this phenomenon?  What is it?

2) Is it a symptom of a deeper problem?  My boss is telling me to
ignore it, but I'm nervous that it might be connected to a virus.

   In browsing through the April 1990 issue of Computers and Security,

Back when it was fun to hack with viral code I thought it would be
necessary to avoid the checksum built into the .EXE header.  The first
approach was to compute a new checksum based on the entire new file.

A better and more efficient way is to simple force the checksum of the
actual added virus code be zero.  That way, any checker will take the
CS of the original file data and add it to the CS of the added virus
code.  This being zero it will result in the same CS as the original.
This method will easily spoof checksums but not CRCs or LRCs.  And I
still don't know how to spoof a combination of these.

I think that there are programs that will wrap around an executable
and detect any changes made to itself.  These can't be beat by the
method described above.  Probably what happens here is the the virus
code gets executed first after being loaded.  It then relocates itself
and hides its tracks.  Then it can pass control back to whatever
program it has infected.  The resulting load image is the same as it
would have been without a virus.

Just some random musings...  jv

[Ed. Unless I'm mistaken, the 4096 doesn't use this sort of mechanism
to hide from checksums; it traps the interrupts that read files and
disinfects files on the fly so that a checksum/crc/whatever actually
sees the non-infected files.]

Subject: Cost of Protection (Philosophy)

          I am astounded by the assertation that $5800 for 100 service
copies of McAfee's SCAN is considered excessive. Considering the
continuing effort, response time, and updates required, the cost seems
minimal compared that of sending technicians out unarmed (yes, we have
a service license). Just the savings in time alone in battling
infections and the knowlege of what you are facing justifies the cost.

          More important, at a time when many manufacturers require
individual copies for each CPU, the concept of the service and site
license, both available from McAfee and very few others, are godsends
to overworked staffs.  Besides which, I can think of very few packages
available for $58 each, much less ones that can be used on any
machine. No-one thinks twice about the telephone company charging more
for a business line than for a residential one.  Similarly, the $25
"shareware" fee for home use cannot be equated to the unlimited use
"service license" fee. If an alternative is desired, nothing is
stopping anyone from writing their own software. For me, the price is
cheap and the concept well worth supporting.

Subject: Disk Killer bug (PC)

The Disk Killer virus has a bug (at least one) that causes it to
sometime/often/usually mark the wrong sectors as bad in the FAT when
it infects a diskette.  If the diskette is later written to, this
often results in the virus's on-disk code being overlayed, rendering
the diskette non-bootable and non-infectious (although the boot sector
is still there, so scanners will still see it as infected).  Does
anyone know in any detail under what circumstances the bug shows up?
From some limited testing, it looks as though the wrong sectors are
marked bad if a freshly- formatted diskette is used in a machine with
the virus in memory, but the right sectors are marked bad if the
diskette already has considerable stuff on it when it becomes
infected.  Does this sound right to others who have looked at it?

Subject: SCAN, Zenith ZDS (PC)

          After my last posting, Mr. McAfee called to tell me that it is
not necessary to boot from a write-protected floppy for SCAN to detect
a virus resident in memory & dangerous ones are checked for each time
SCAN runs (to check for all memory resident viruses, the /m option
should be used). Since some machines require special drivers for fixed
disk access that would not be on the floppy, this is good to know.

          During our installation of Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe on PCs we
experienced problems on a limited but significant number of Zenith 158
& 159 (PC & XT) machines: Each time one booted up, a changed boot
sector was reported. Use of DEBUG revealed that something in the OS
was periodically placing a time stamp in the boot record (logical
sector 0) and Virus-Safe was properly flagging the change. Hard drives
formatted with the signatures ZDS3.1 and ZDS3.2 (Z-DOS ver 3.1 & 3.2)
were the most prevalent.

          A call to Zenith revealed that they had had some reports of
that type and would have to get back with me about exactly what was
going on. They also stated that while some anti-virus routines had
reported difficulty, others did not. When I have more information, it
will be passed on. In the meantime, if you have a Zenith that reports
constant changes to the boot sector, this may be the problem (then
again, maybe you have a boot sector infector).
