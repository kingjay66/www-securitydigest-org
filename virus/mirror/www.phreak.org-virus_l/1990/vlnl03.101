VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

In a document I wrote I implied the same thing about BBSs, so I feel I
ought to speak up here and state my opinion that this is no longer
true, if it ever was.  I use many BBSs that now make a point of
telling users that all software has been scanned with an up-to-date
tool.  I personally feel that the home user interested in virus
protection ought to get a modem and investigate BBSs, albeit with
careful attention, as there are many well-run systems that do a real
service with regard to spreading virus-prevention information and
tools.  Unfortunately, a bad attitude towards BBSs persists, thus an
effective and low-cost method of distributing useful information
doesn't get taken as seriously as it should.

Unfortunately, my copy of Cuckoo's Egg is at home so I am trying to
recall this off of the top of my head.  One of the hackers involved,
specifically the one who dealt directly with the Eastern Block was
found dead soon after the arrests.  I believe there is some question
as to whether it was murder or suicide.  From the way Cliff describes
the incident, it sounded like murder.

Cliff is a very informative and entertaining speaker with a very
unique style of presenting information.  If you have the opportunity
to see him (or invite him to your facility) I think you will find it
worth the time.

       Response to Ross Greenberg posting in VIRUS-L Vol. 3 Issue 74

            Unfortunately,  I have not yet perfected Internet access  so
       apologize  for being late to respond to Mr. Greenberg's  comments
       from  11 April. It does seem as if he has chosen to interpret  my
       posting  and respond to this interpretation rather than what  was
       actually said.

            I  must state first that my task is to protect  our  systems
       from  ANY  attack, not just the amateurs who write  (badly)  most
       viruses. One of our contracts involves the FAA Air Traffic  Control
       system and readers would most likely agree that authentication of
       that   traffic  and  its  programs  demands  somewhat   increased
       authentication.

       >particluar method I use in my code for generating a signature, I would
       >hope that the bad guys are as easily fooled by someone using the word
       >"Checksum" or "CRC" as you were.  <Gotcha! Heheheh>

            I never stated that this was what Mr. Greenberg used, rather
       that  inside  an authenticated platform such  measures  would  be
       adequate. The word used to refer to Mr. Greenberg's products  was
       "algorithm". I cannot limit concern to easily fooled "bad guys".

       >I may include such a random seed in the future, but it seems pretty
       >easy to be able to determine that seed and therefore why bother?

            Not   if  the  seed  is  input  by  the   installer   during
       installation, is unique for each machine, and is not used outside
       of  that  machine (earlier I stated that a more  rigorous  method
       would  be used for transmissions between machines). Such  a  seed
       would only be "easy to determine" if the penetrator had access to
       that  machine and even then the seed would only work on that  one
       machine.

       >Better still would be to use two differing algorithms that
       >combine into one unique signature.

            That's what I said: Machine unique seed and one-of-nine algorithm
       selection not determined by the seed.

       >Fascinating number, that 90%.  No justification for it from what I can
       >see.  And your statement on the Boot Sector's first byte being the
       >important one to check is totally wrong.  If you could send me the

       >numbers I see bandied about regarding viruses.  Too easy to slip a
       >decimal point or two, or to extrapolate from a limited subset.

            Fair  enough.  I have only a limited sample  to  draw  from:
       20,000  machines  in five states and the  District  of  Columbia.
       Though  my collection is somewhat greater, we have only seen  MS-
       DOS  attacks  by the Pakistani Brain, Yale - Alameda  -  Merritt,
       Jerusalem,  Disk Killer, Stoned, and some variants. EVERY ONE  of
       these  is detectable by the methods mentioned PROVIDED  they  are
       performed in the order stated.

            My  personal  belief  (open to  correction)  is  that  these
       constitute  the  bulk of the viruses for  this  platform  currently
       active in America and that the 90% figure is low. The future will
       be different but my reference was to March, 1990. Certainly I  am
       sick of seeing the Jerusalem in particular.

       ps. Since writing this, I see that David Chess states that the
            Bouncing-Ball and 1701/4 are now among the front-runners.
            The method mentioned will pick up the 1701/4 but I have not
            tried (or seen except as simulation) the Ping-Pong.

Subject: 1813 virus sighting (PC)

   We had a small epidemic of the 1813 virus on our lab PCs, which has
since been eradicated (we hope).  Symptoms were the appearance of black
squares on the screen, and deletion of executable files was reported on
one pc.  Either that one was farther along, or there was a second virus
which was not detected by the IBM virus scanning program.
   There was also an incidence of the stoned virus in another department,
but it didn`t do anything that I know of.
   Where can I get a list of viruses and their symptoms, and is there a v
virus-checker for PCs available (for free? ) from the internet?

From:    "McMahon,Brian D" <MCMAHON@GRIN1.Bitnet>
Subject: Garfield/MDEF Ramblings (Mac)

Here are a few thoughts and some wild speculation inspired by the reports
of the new Garfield/MDEF beastie...

HYPOTHESIS:  This critter was in some way or another inspired by WDEF.

SUPPORTING ARGUMENT:  In the pre-WDEF world, Mac viruses mostly followed
the standard pattern of zarking around with the "classical" executable
code-bearing resources, i.e. INIT and CODE resources, to do their dirty
work.  Of course, they could also carry along code in additional resources,
as nVir, but relied on INITs and/or CODEs for the initial hook.  WDEF was a
dramatic demonstration of the ability of certain other resources to carry
executable code.

I know it's quite POSSIBLE for a programmer to independently come up with
the idea of using an MDEF for nefarious purposes; it seems to me that it's
more PROBABLE that someone said, "hey that WDEF thing's neat, I wonder if I
can do the same with an MDEF?"  (Note that Garfield's use of an MDEF does
*not* bring the same sort of advantage that WDEF's novel propagation method
did, namely defeating Vaccine and GateKeeper.  I can't think of ANY
significant advantage, other than maybe evading some simple detection
schemes based on checking CODE resorces only.  I think Garfield was
perpetrated for pure "hack value," and before WDEF most virus-writing types
apparently didn't THINK of using other resources.)

CONCLUSION:  If the above hypothesis is granted (my new Nomex-lined mailbox
should be here any day now :-)), then we know that Garfield's development
time plus any latency period plus the time it spread undetected is no
greater than 5 months.  (First WDEF reports in December '89, Garfield
identified May '90.)  Interesting, and possibly even useful.  :-)  With the
timely notification and the rapid development of counter-measures, the next
few weeks should tell us how widespread this thing already is.  (Thanks to
the Cornell folks, John Norstad, et al. for great response!)

If it turns out that few sites besides Cornell are affected, it might even
be possible to contain this thing.  (Not likely, IMHO.)  It could be
interesting to follow the spread, though.  (There he goes again...)

SUGGESTION:  Thinking back to the deluge of WDEF reports a few months ago,
I wonder if we could coordinate reporting of Garfield a bit better?  For
instance, I could offer to collect sightings and summarize to the list
every so often.  What do you all think?  Would this be a useful thing to
do, or a waste of time and disk space?

OTHER HYPOTHESIS:  Remember my ravings back in Virus-L 3/36 about WDEF's
spread, college vacation schedules, and such?  I suggested that the flurry
of WDEF reports in Jan-Feb of this year was connected to the start of a new
semester.  (I think it was Dave Platt who sent me a brief, insightful note
on this.  Wish I could find it now, I must have put it in a "Safe Place.")

Anyway, guess what just happened all over the country.  I presume Cornell
is or will soon be on summer break?  Students from all over the country
gone home, taking infected floppies with them?  If Garfield follows the
WDEF pattern, we might see a few instances in the next few months, followed
by a sharp increase in reports during Aug-Sept as the academic vectors
return to classes.

Then again, the pattern may be different here.  Unlike WDEF, Garfield *is*
inhibited by already-existing, widely available countermeasures.  As a
result, it might not run out of control quite as rapidly.

Speaking of running out of control, this posting is getting to be rather
long, so I'll shut up now.  Comments and criticism are welcome.

The listserv /pdget support implemented at RPIECS and NDSUVM1 is
simply an interface to download files from simtel20.  If it was
clean on simtel20, it's clean via /pdget.

I can verify this, as I have seen the code to implement /pdget.

Gatekeeper will *completely* block the MDEF virus.  The same is *not*
true of Vaccine, however.  Vaccine blocks only half of the operations
attempted by MDEF as it tries to infect the System file.  The end
result is that when you use Vaccine to block MDEF infections on
certain kinds of Macs, you'll wind up with a system in which the
default menu definition function can no longer be found, which means
that you won't see any more menus....

When Gatekeeper blocks an infection by MDEF, it blocks it completely;
no modifications to the System are permitted, so no damage is done.

I hope this helps,

"Virii" is what's known as a "pseudo-learned" form.  "Pseudo" because
the people using it are showing off that they know enough of Latin to
know that long "-i" is a plural ending for some words ending in "-us",
but not enough to know that it's a second-declension plural ending.
There are some "-us" words that are fourth-declension, and the plural
is "-us" with a long 'u'.  Since this isn't an accepted English
language form, we use the default pluralisation rules, and add "-es"
after the final 's'.  Hence, "viruses".  (For those who are wondering,
there is no particular order to declensions, they are just a convenient
partition for ways to form case-and-number endings for nouns and
adjectives.)

I'm sure I'll have to write this again ...
