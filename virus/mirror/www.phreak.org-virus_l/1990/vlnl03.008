VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

SCANV55 has been released.  IT is able to detect the 4096 virus in
memory prior to doing a scan.  The 4096 is similar to the Dark Avenger
in that it infects every executable file that is opened.

CLEANP55 (Clean-Up) is also now available on HomeBase.  It's the
shareware equivalent of the VirClean commercial program (from Hirst
and McAfee).  Clean-Up uses I.D.'s displayed by SCAN55 to determine
which virus to check for and remove.  It repairs the infected programs
and returns the system to normal in most cases.  Clean-Up now replaces
all of the individual disinfectors that had been available on
HomeBase.  About time!

With this scheme, what prevents a clever nasty from simply patching
the code doing the comparison to always return an all clear?  Also,
while the non- repudiation property seems to provide accountability,
it seems likely to be illusory.  Does the signer of the program really
know what's being signed or was it generated by some other program of
uncertain honesty?

I have uploaded the following files to SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
NETSCN54.ARC    Network compatible - scan for 60 viruses, v54
SCANRS54.ARC    Resident virus infection prevention program
SCANV54.ARC     VirusScan, scans disk files for 60 viruses

These programs where downloaded from the Homebase BBS.

I hope I am not saying something that everyone already knows about,
but Newark Hall is infected with the Mac virus WDEF A.  It is a very
infective virus.  I took my work disk home inserted it into my mac
Plus and then went to open Disinfectant and by the time I ran it my
hard drive was infected, and I'm sure it wasn't infected before.

Even if it doesn't do any damage (am I right about this?) I find that
to be very obnoxious.
