Subject: Stone virus & Scan 3.1v59 (PC)

Hello,

Two queries:

        1. Could someone inform me of the symptoms of the
        STONE virus?

        2. I intent to install AcAfee's SCAN 3.1v59 on my
        computer. Will this do a good job of detecting
        possible virus infection or is there a more recent
        update of the program? Any comments are welcome.

You can answer me personally or through the list if you feel
that the information can benefit other people. Thanks in advance.

Subject: Re: removing Stoned from harddisks (PC)

I had a friend call me who told me that Stoned actually damaged the
media on the hard drive.  He said they lost a full ten Meg. He took
the drive through a low-level + dos format, and only wound up with
20Meg on a 30 meg disk.

Now, I know that a piece of software isn't supposed to physically
destroy media, but he said that the tech from the disk company claimed
that Stoned actually does destroy the media permanantly.  I don't
pretend to know everything about the pc, do I told him I'd ask here.
My bet is that the drive was either mis-labled as a 30 meg, or somehow
partitioned wrong.

Subject: Zipped packages, lzexe, and viruses

Thu 7-Jun-90: Lzexed files pose a problem for the present virus
scanners.  While waiting to see the announced scanv63 to appear with
abilities to scan lzexe-compressed files, I wrote a batch to handle
scanning .zip packages.  This bacth checks both ordinary and lzexed
files within a .zip package.  The following shareware and PD
programs are needed: pkunzip.exe, scan.exe, islzexe.exe,
unlzexe.exe, The packages containing these programs can be found
from good BBSes and eg from chyde.uwasa.fi by anonymous ftp.  The
new batch scanzip.bat is included in the updated /pc/ts/tsbat20.arc
batch file collection.  Available by anonymous ftp from
chyde.uwasa.fi, Vaasa, Finland, in the usual manner.

Subject: Possible virus or trojan (Mac)? Help!!!

     I've got a strange Mac problem and need help.  Monday night, one
  of my colleagues allowed a friend in to the office to steal Mac software
  (using his old Mac disks, of course).  After the appropriate cussing-out
  and running-off, the machine in question (Mac SE, 20Mb hard disk, System
  6.0.3) started acting funny.  Symptoms:

       a.  We can't find any virii on it with Disinfectant 1.6 or 1.8
       b.  Suddenly icons can't find their applications
       c.  Applications are increasingly unable to open data files or
           find them
       d.  The parameters of applications like Versaterm are unaccountably
           changing themselves i.e. the baud rate changes itself or the
           Kermit parameters change for no known reason
       e.  The options of the System and Desktop are unaccountably changing
           themselves i.e. the sound bar is turned up without anyone having
           done it.
       f.  There are more system bombs, and other disk and ram error messages
           than I've ever seen before in two years of working with Macs.

      We're to the point now of chucking months worth of data and reformating
  the hard disk and starting over.  Any suggestions?  Any help?
  Anybody seen anything like this before?

>I disagree with your premise about Unix vs. VM or MVS security, though.
>MVS has been in development far longer than Unix has been alive (even
>back beyond the days of MVT)....

I would not want to get into an argument about it, but the difference in
age is not signigficant.  Unix is much older than you might guess.

>.... and there are many shops that use MVS and VM >(IBM ain't making
>it on PS/2s alone).

Total licenses for MVS and VM are measured in the low tens of thousands.

>Thus, these operating systems have
>had much more opportunity for people to poke around in them.

I doubt that this is true in terms of years or hours.  It is likely true
in terms of determination and other resources.  Total reported integrity
flaws in MVS have likely been in the high tens.  Almost none were detected
or exploited by hackers.  Most were detected by people with special
knowledge and training after the expenditure of significant resources.

>Not to say they are invincible, mind you, but I think they're less
>susceptible than Unix.

Your confidence is poorly placed.  While MVS and VM are as secure as
IBM knows how to make them collectively, individual installations or
instances are likely no better than instances of Unix.  People who do
penetration studies of MVS and VM for a living report that eighty-five
percent will yield privilege to a knowledgeable attacker in hours to days.
Most will yield to a determined attacker in days, and less than one percent
will stand up for weeks.

This has little to do with design or implementation by IBM but with use
and management by their customers.  Most MVS and VM installations are
guilty of exactly the same kinds of problems as are reported in the
"Cuckoo's Egg."  The book takes its name from the attack that exploits the
gnu-emacs editor that runs privileged.  MVS installations are rife with
very general utilities that run privileged and have poor controls.

All of this has little to do with their vulnerability to viruses.  As
Dave Chess of IBM Research has tried to explain on this list several
times, viruses exploit the privileges of users rather than flaws in the
environment.  Operating system integrity and access controls will only
slow them.  If users have the privilege to execute an arbitrary program
of their own choice, can create or modify a procedure, and share data
with a sufficiently large population of peers, then that is all that is
required for the success of a virus.

The trick to the success of a virus is not in its code, but in how you get
it executed!

New viruses do not sell product.  Old viruses sell product.  There
are not enough copies of a new virus to be noticed.

Has anyone heard when the new upgrade of VIREX was shipped?  I work at
an academic computing center who is registered with the VIREX upgrade
program and as of 07-June-1990, we have not yet received the newest
version, which checks for MDEF.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

I will overlook the fact that in order to reverse the speaker wires etc,
it looks to me that you have to physically open the case.  At this point,
what's to stop the person from whatever he feels like?

"Security" doesn't mean much when the guy has already opened the box up
and is able to physically abuse the silicon.  You got a hard disk?  He can
REPLACE it with a (almost identical, but infected) copy.  You got a hardware
security module?  That can be ripped out.  And so on...

What is making the guy wait 20 mins buying you security-wise?  Do you have
a security guard who walks by every 15 minutes?  If so, you're probably a
site that has heavy duty security - why is an unknown person walking around
unescorted?  And if there's NOT a security guard walking by every 15
minutes, then most likely if the guy has enough time to rip it open, he
won't be bothered during a further 20 minute wait.

I've just received a copy of a virus called "Armagedon the GREEK".
Have anyone ever seen this virus? SCAN 62 did not identify this virus
so I consider this as a new virus. I've checked it a bit and from what
I found out, at a certain time, the virus sends a special command to
your ports which a Hayes compatible modem can understand!

Greek fellows: What does the phone number 081-141 mean?

I'll make a larger report after I will finish disassembling this virus!

   Can anyone supply us all with info as to just where this Steroid trojan
has been found, what the presumed route of communication has been, etc.?
   Trojans, by their very nature, don't tend to spread as far as viruses.
Unless, perhaps, posted to a number of bulletin boards.  Or shrink-wrapped.
(Hmm.  I've certainly run across shrink-wrapped software that makes me feel
like I'm up against a trojan horse.  Operating systems, as well as applica-
tion packages.)  Where a trojan has appeared, and in how many different
places, will determine the nature of an organization's response.  I don't
like to push the panic button except when justified.
   Thanks much.

Subject: First jailed UK computer hacker

>From a UK newspaper called 'The Daily Telegraph', Friday 8 June 1990:-

['Mad Hacker' jailed for computer war]

A computer operator who called himself "The Mad Hacker" became the first in
Britain to be jailed for the offence yesterday. Nicholas Whiteley,  21,  of
Enfield,  north  London,  was sentenced to 4 months with a further 8 months
suspended for criminally damaging computer  disks  and  wreaking  havoc  on
university  systems. Whiteley, who, it was said, was driven by a desire top
become Britain's top hacker, wept in the dock and held  his  hands  to  his
face as he walked to the cells to begin his sentence.

Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, described him as "very malicious and  arrogant",
and  told  him:  "Anyone minded to behave in this way must be deterred from
doing so.".

Whiteley declared war on computer experts, using a computer in his  bedroom
to  swamp  university  computers  with masses of useless material including
threats and boasts about his brilliance. One  said:  "Don't  mess  with  me
because I am extremely nutty.".

He was found guilty last month of 4 charges of causing damage  to  magnetic
disks in mainframe computers at the universities of London, Bath, and Hull.
The judge said some of the computers stored important and confidential data
relating to medical and scientific research.

Subject: 1451COM / 1411EXE ? new virus (PC) ?

Here is some (of the rare) news from Yugoslavia:

We have had some 'classical' PC viruses for two years now: 1701, 1704,
Brain, Bouncing Ball, Jerusalem (1813COM/1808EXE), Yankee Doodle like
(2885COM/2880EXE), Yankee Doodle (2772COM/2772EXE) and Disk Killer.
Now it seems we have another uninvited guest.

In early June I was given a sample of a virus, found in a small SW
engineering company. They detected no strange behaviour but prolongation
of COM and EXE files. I disassembled it and I'm posting a brief report:

VirusName       : ?, (1451COM/1411EXE)
Type            : indirect executable code infector
Infects         : COM and EXE files
VirusBodyLength : 1451 bytes (COM), 1411 bytes (EXE)
Expanding victim: YES, to paragraph boundary, both COM and EXE
Location in RAM : before end of memory
Steals interrupt: 21h
Intercepts func.: 40h (write to file), 4Bh (load & execute)
Attacks         : Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec., each year
Action          : When executing int 21h, func. 40h (write to file)
                  intercepts the call. If triggered the action code
                  increments register DX by 0Ah, changing the address
                  of buffer to be written to disk.
Consequences    : wrong data (or garbage) written to disk

Program package RETROVIR (c) Proteus detects and removes the
1451COM/1411EXE from disk, along with all the other viruses mentioned
above.

I will be glad to receive reports on this virus from elsewhere.
Does anyone know its origin?

Has anyone out there any experience of running the diagnostics disk supplied
with the Samsung S800 (AT compatible)? Specifically, any problems when you
BOOT from this disk on a system with a hard disk?
(Please do not 'try it out' now to see what happens.)
Is there anyone out there who could examine the boot sector of said disk
and let me know if it looks OK?

I would like to pinpoint the source of a problem which occurred recently,
when a machine crashed unexpectedly.

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPLICATION OF ANY SORT IN THE ABOVE QUESTIONS!!
