To clear up a point:

It is a DUMB virus - the strings are in ASCII not encrypted in any way.

'dedicated' is NOT a good signature as the editor points out.  It can
appear in many files - it was but a quick and dirty way to check.

Using GREP, the context in which the string appears becomes apparent and
thus you know if you have an infected file or not.

BTW the program STRINGS is something I have had for years - it goes
searching through any specified file and reports all the ASCII text
it can find - a very useful utiity.

By now John McAfee should have a copy of 1022 so expect to see
a forthcoming version of SCAN being able to detect 1022.

There is also an Australian scanning product, NBY, put out by a
local anti-virus guru - Claude Almer.
His latest version of NBY (Version 122) already detects 1022

If you wish to get a copy and don't mind the cost of the phone call
you can call his BBS on 61 2 482 1716

Subject: Electric Toothbrush (PC)

A colleague found a program listed in RAM (as revealed by
WordPerfect's shell program memory map) identified as Electric
Toothbrush.  He thinks it could be evidence of a virus, although scan
v.64 did not find one.  I think it more likely to be something that
WordPerfect's clipboard mistakenly picked up, but he tells me that
those words were not used in a document or otherwise that day.  The
machine is a 286 IBM clone with DOS 3.3 and WordPerfect's Library.
Any suggestions?

The aftermath of Ogre/Disk Killer

     It was  mentioned by  me and others that the damage done by Ogre/Disk
Killer can  be repaired.  Unfortunately we  were wrong.  The  virus  plows
through the  disk, encrypting  every track  as it  goes. As the encryption
method used is reversable, I assumed that it would be no problem to create
a routine  to restore  the disk.  I made  the mistake of assuming that the
routine the  virus-programmer used  was flawless. Well, it wasn't. In fact
it containes  at least  three major  mistakes, that  make it impossible to
restore an encrypted disk automatically.
     The virus  saves the  original Master-Boot-Sector (MBS) on the second
absolute sector,  irrespective of what was originally there. My experience
is that  more hard  disks do  not use  that sector,  but can one guarantee
this? On  floppies this  sector IS  used by  the FAT,  so floppies  can be
excluded from  restoration right from the start. After the encryption, the
first absolute  sector is  replaced by a sector containing the data needed
to restore  the hard disk. This is where the first major mistake lies: the
programmer forgot  to save  the number of heads the hard disk has. This is
not that serious though, as one usually knows how many heads the disk has.
I used another trick: my program decrypts the MBS in sector 2 and uses the
number of heads stored there. The virus itself uses the number of heads as
stored in  the bootsector.  There might  be some  outlandish  partitioning
where the  actual  number  of  heads  differs  from  that  stored  in  the
bootsector.
     As the first sector is overwritten after encryption, some information
is lost  that is  needed to  decrypt the  MBS in sector 2. It is possible,
using a trick, to decrypt everything except the first two bytes.
     The virus  records whether an error occured while encrypting a track.
It does this by setting a bit corrosponding to the track in a table stored
in sector  1. Due  to a  programming error,  the routine  to calculate the
index of  the bit  in the  table will cause a division by zero error after
800h/(number of  heads) tracks  (eg. 341  on a disk with 6 heads). Because
the virus does not handle this eventuality, the routine will abort and all
of the information that is necessary for restoration and usually stored in
sector 1 will not be written: ie. the disk is in an unknown state. This is
the second major mistake.
     So far  the errors can be circumvented by manually selecting the disk
parameters and  the sectors to be restored. The last error I found, dashed
all my  hopes of  restoring the  disk in question. While moving the MBS to
sector 2,  the programmer  made the mistake of assuming that BIOS restores
the contents of the AL register on return from a read. It usually doesn't,
although the programmer's machine must have. My BIOS returns a zero in AL.
When the  virus executes a write to disk without resetting the AL register
to one,  unpredictable things  happen. The virus has affectively told BIOS
to write  zero sectors  to disk.  What happened on my machine was that the
FAT and  the ROOT directory were overwritten with junk. This left the disk
quite unusable. :-(
     After encrypting what one can on the disk, it is possible to use disk
utilities to  access the  data on a sector-to-sector basis, but not in any
sensible manner.  I expect  that for  some people even this is better than
losing their  data completely.  The encryption  process should  be left to
experts, as it is risky and you only have one shot. I have done this for a
customer before, but unfortunately all three errors had occured and little
could be saved. (One of Murphy's Laws had something about this...*sigh*.)
     I expect  the programmer of the virus had an strange BIOS version and
a small  hard disk.  Under those  circumstances the  errors would not have
occured in  testing. I doubt if these mistakes were intentional. There are
cheaper ways of destroying a disk.
     This virus gives me yet another good opportunity for my usual pitter-
patter: Back  up your  disks REGULARLY;  back up  DATA, not programs; keep
original program disks WRITE-PROTECTED in a safe (from yourself) place; do
not rely entirely on antiviruses, but rather on your COMMON SENSE and STAY
CLEAN. This  goes for  all viruses and for other mishaps. (A cup of coffee
is still a computer's worst enemy.)

Subject: First Documented sighting of the "4096" virus in the U.S.A. (PC)

July 13, 1990

*** First Documented sighting of the "4096" virus in the U.S.A. ***

The 4k (a.k.a. 4096, IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, Frodo, 100 Years,
Stealth) virus has turned up in the Dallas TX area.

A computer dealer about 50 miles south of Dallas TX noticed a few
unexplainable system crashes over the last 2 weeks. Upon investigation, he
found that EXE file sizes were increased by 4 - 5k bytes. He copied a
sample off to diskette, and sent it to RG Software Systems, Inc. for
examination. A quick check using our Vi-Spy product found the 4k virus.

This dealer is now undergoing an intensive operation to locate and remove
all occurrances of the 4k using Vi-Spy. Thus far he has found his demo
systems infected; several customers' systems infected; and believes that
some demo disks that he has shipped have carried the virus. In addition to
clearing up the problem in his own shop, he's contacting his customers and
has taken the very unusual and commendable position of "going public"
through an interview with Tom Steinert-Threlkeld of the Dallas Morning
News, to let others in the Dallas area know of the problem. The story is
in the Monday, July 16 edition of the paper.

The dealer believes he received the infection from a local software
consultant who believes he got it from a local private BBS. (This
consultant utilizes "many" private BBS'es and works for several companies
in the Dallas area.)

At this stage, we do not know how widespread the infection is, however due
to the "Stealth" logic this virus employs to avoid detection, and the
extremely prolific nature of its infection logic (infects any EXE or COM
file OPENED, AND it infects COMMAND.COM) it can go a long way before
becoming noticed. Once a system is infected, this virus gives no obvious
signs of its presence. Only an experienced and very perceptive user may
notice its activity, and then probably only by accident.

Since there is no direct trigger, the system crashes seem to be occurring
only after massive infection whereby many program files have been expanded
by 4 - 5k bytes and disk resources are used up.

[Ed. After posting this message, Ray called me back to inform me that
the virus does indeed have a trigger - on or after September 22, 1990
- - at which time it will crash the system and/or delete the boot
sector, while attempting to display a message, "Frodo lives".]

Upon examination at RG, we've determined this virus matches the sample we
have in our Lab, which we had received from colleagues in Europe.

Subject: 640 K ? (PC)

I just ran Immune version 9.0 and was informed that there was only
639K insatead of 640K (PS/2 - 60). I then ran Scanres 1.4V61 and it
checked out ok at 640K ! Is anyone familiar with the probl Do I
have some mean and nasty bug ?

Subject: Ping Pong virus infection (PC)

    We (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) were also hit with the Ping Pong
 virus!  Our strain appeared to do nothing but destroy/write over a random
 program/file on our hard disks.  However, I had the same experience as
 you did (sys doesn't work) with one hard disk out of ~100 infections.
    The only explanation that I could think of for such a rare/strange case
 of a virus was that the sys command was executed from a different DOS
 version.  In my case, I think that the computer I was trying to fix was
 running DOS v. 3.2.  However, the rest of this school is running DOS
 v 3.3a!  If this was the case, I could see were my problem developed!
    Please keep me updated on your situation (I do not think that our
 Ping Pong infection will EVER go away).  Good luck...

Subject: Issues of Virus-L received truncated

Some users including  me have been  receiving  some issues of  Virus-L
truncated.  (When I  manage to get a complete  copy  of  the truncated
issue,  I notice  that th e  next line  after the  truncation point is
fullstop-by-itself, which some  emai l nodes treat as end-of-message).
How many other users have had this problem ?

This can also be caused  by a sentence ending at  the end of a line of
81 characters.  When the  line is split after  its 80th character, the
terminating fullstop is left on a line by itself.
