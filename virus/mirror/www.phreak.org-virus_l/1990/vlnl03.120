You are correct in that VMS 4.3 was rated at C2 (Discretionary Access
Controls).  This was for VAX/VMS without DECnet. Subsequent versions
do NOT automatically qualify for the C2 rating.  This does not mean
that the operating system is not secure (unless we're talking V4.4
which had a bug), but it means that the new release was never
re-tested.  VMS still meets the Orange Book criteria, it just lacks
the formal certification.

The NCSC is handling this problem with their RAting Maintenance
Phase (RAMP) program. They are in the process of training the vendor
community on the necessary rules and criteria for assuring that future
releases of a product continue to meet the criteria under which the
original rating was granted.

The RAMP program is new, so VMS 4.3 was not included in it. DEC
currently has a "future version" of VMS undergoing recertification by
the NCSC at the C2 level. This version, when rated, will be placed
into the RAMP program so that future updates will continue to be
released with the rating current. In the mean time, DEC personnel are
being trained in the RAMP program by the NCSC.

There are also several versions of UNIX being certified at C2. None of
which to my knowledge are under the RAMP program, however the
individual vendors should be able to supply that information.

For those interested, the NCSC has two publications available which
apply to this discussion, one is the "Rating Maintenance Phase Program
Document", and the other is the Final Report on the certification of
VAX/VMS V4.3.

Subject: new virus (PC)

I just received a new virus from a friend, the first analysis shows the
following facts:
   Resident virus that infects COM and EXE files!
   It is a appending virus that modifies the EXE header.
   Infection trigger INT 21 subfunction 4Bh (load and execute)
   Infection length 688 bytes.
   Processes R/O and hidden files correctly and restores time and date
      stamp as well as attributes after infection.
   Contains a new way of detecting R/O floppy disks
   Fools debuggers to prevent reverse engineering.
   Selfdetection in memory is not sufficient. (So you might have several
      copies of the virus TSR active)
   Payload: starting with june 1990 it hooks INT 08 and after a random
      time it starts to toggle the screen blanking bit every 7 minutes
      5 cycles. This will only work on MDA, Hercules, CGA but not on
      EGA and VGA. The effect will be a screen flicker that might be
      confused with a bad contact in the CRT system.

I have heard rumours that a suspicious floppy-disk is being posted
around in Britain (and possibly Europe too). It purports to come from
a body calling itself 'The Customer Satisfaction Research Institute'.
Anyone come across one of these? If so, is it widely circulated?
Or is it just a panic-generator? Am I worrying needlessly?

CA-ACF2 MVS and CA-TOP SECRET MVS were approved for acceptance into the
Trusted Product Evaluation Program on 15 June 1990.  Although we are not
yet listed in the "Potential Products List" on the Announce forum of
Dockmaster (even the 07/02/90 edition, transaction [0162]), I have the
letter from the NCSC in front of me that says we are indeed in the
evaluation program.

Subject: Possible virus or trojan attacks (PC)

The following two separate "attacks" were reported to have occured
on several Rio de Janeiro computers:

1. The CMOS memory on AT computers got scrambled. Time-date and other
set-up information got chaged. Some files were corrupted.

2. The FORMAT function with systyem transfer was disrupted on
several machines and system disks at one site. The command proceeded
normally with all the normal messages except that in the end the
formatted disks would not boot. The same happened when SAFE-FORMAT
was used. The problem was solved by re-transfering the system with
SYS from a known clean disk.

Unfortunately both problems were resolved without keeping a copy of
the culprit so it's now impossible to find out exactly what had
happened. I would like to know though if anyone else has come across
similar problems.

The NCSC has a program known as RAMP <Rating Maintenance Program>.  Should
a vendor be willing to incur some additional costs, NCSC will verify future
versions of the system in order to maintain compliance.  Keep in mind that
NCSC verification teams are usually assigned according to their experience;
as a matter of fact, the Orange Book dictates that they will have "assembly
language ability or the equivalent" on the machine being evaluated.  Since
NCSC also requires "internals programming ability on the level of writing a
device driver" for verification team members <in some circumstances>, it
seems to me that the same people are committed to evaluating a given system
throughout its lifetime.  Given that, RAMP is probably an expensive propo-
sition for a vendor.

Another consideration would be this: do the later versions of VMS contain
"features" that are not allowable under C2 certification?  I'm not familiar
with VMS, so perhaps someone else could comment on this.

Subject: TSR virus checker wanted (PC)

I'm sure this has been asked before, but I just started reading this
group -- maybe somebody can e-mail me an answer.  I'm looking for a
memory-resident virus checker for the IBM XT & AT that would constantly
monitor critical areas and block viruses from attacking.  Does such a
thing exist?  Commercial or public domain?

Also, which of the various programs on Simtel is recommended for
locating and removing a wide range of viruses?

Speaking of Simtel, I just figured out how to ftp files.  Before I go
wild, how safe are the various files from viruses?  Any risk?  Some
risk? A lot of risk?

Many thanks.

Subject: Rating of VMS V4.3 and "maintainance of rating"

John 'Fast-Eddie' McMahon says:

	I have gotten conflicting answers on this, so I'll ask again...

	My understanding is that VMS 4.3 was the version rated at C2, and that
	rating did not automatically carry over to later versions of VMS.
	Hence, if you are running 4.3 you have (potentially) a C2 system.  But
	if you are running 4.4 through 5.4 you don't.

	Can someone explain how these ratings apply when a system is upgraded?

Actually, there isn't any conflict here.  A rating is given to a PARTICULAR
implementation on PARTICULAR hardware.  It is not applicable to any other
versions of the system, or to any other hardware.

The C2 rating for VMS applied only to VMS V4.3, since that was the only
version actually submitted for the rating process.  Further, it applied only
to the hardware available at the time - NONE of which is sold by DEC any more!

There are further restrictions.  For example, there is to this day no standard
for security of networked systems, much less any rating process for them (al-
though there is plenty of work in this area, and I suppose my information on
this could already be obsolete.)  So a VMS V4.3 system, running on the appro-
priate kind of hardware, would STILL not have a C2 rating if it were connected
to a network - even a network of identical machines!

Obviously, given the realities of hardware and software development, it is in
everyone's interest to provide some way to retain a rating from one version of
a system to another.  The proposed technique - I'm not sure if it's been im-
plemented yet - goes as follows:  The vendor designates a small number of its
employees (like 2!) as "rating specialists".  They receive special training
from the NCSC, and then have the job of certifying that changes made between
versions do not affect those portions of the system that were significant in
allowing the system to be rated at a particular level.  If there HAVE been
some changes, I think there's supposed to be an expedited review process of
just the changes, rather than a re-rating effort for the system as a whole.

Presumably a similar process applies as well to the same software running on
new hardware.

Given the long time that has elapsed and the number of changes that have been
made to VMS in the interim, it's highly doubtful that anything of much use
could be retained for a re-rating at this point.

The 4096 is very widespread at present in Israel (where it is more
commonly known as the "Frodo" or "100 Years" virus).  It was disco-
vered in this country about a year ago.  (Judging from the fact that
one of its many nicknames is "IDF", it was presumably first discovered
in the Israel Defense Forces.)

  As many readers of VIRUS-L know, it is a very sophisticated virus.
A description of it was given in the May issue of the Virus Bulletin
(published in the UK).

Subject: VMS security/Secure Un*x

DEC was working on something to keep their security rating with each
new version of VMS; I'd assume they've done it by now.  The new
features in VMS 5.2 and up are fairly major -- system security can be
set to a VERY high level, if one is so inclined.

>From what I've head of AT&T's secure Un*x, it doesn't quite have the
same degree of privilege separation as VMS.  Also, rumor has it that
someone at AT&T managed to find critical holes in the distribution
version of it.  I hope those were repaired.

I don't think (correct me if I am wrong) that secure Un*x can take the
same degree of evasive action that VMS can.  You can have the VMS
system lock out terminal/server ports, accounts, even crash itself if
too serious an attempt is made to compromise system security.

This discussion about MVS security has reminded me of a quote a couple
of years back (I think I read it in a Jim Goodwin posting or article,
but I can't remember if it was origional or he quoted it).  Anyway, it
goes something like: "The only truly secure computer system is one
that is cast in concrete and thrown to the bottom of the ocean.  And
even then, I'm not to sure..."

A pessimistic outlook, but a degree of truth to it nonetheless.

   A few of our PC-Clones here have developed what appears to be
