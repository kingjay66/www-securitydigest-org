Subject: "Washing cycle" TSR (PC)

The description matches that of a program called DRAIN.COM, however DRAIN
is not a TSR or virus.  In the versions that I have seen it is simply an
amusing program.

(Which, of course, does not preclude someone having "hacked" it ... )

Subject: DOS viri and OS/2 (PC)

Kevin Haney wanted to know about DOS viri working on OS/2 machines.
One of our operations/support people recently got himself infected
while trying to deal with a virus from a user's machine.

The operator's PC is normally running OS/2, but has a FAT structured
hard disk so as to be able to boot DOS off a floppy.  I was not
(unfortunately) called in at the beginning of the attempt, so I am not
usre how the operator infected himself, but when I did get called in I
found that "Stoned" had infected the partition boot record of the hard
disk, aand was resident in memory as well.  However, I did not succeed
in inducing it to infect the disks we offered it as bait, so perhaps
(perhaps, mind you) it wasn't active.

Subject: EB21 or PrintScreen virus (PC)

Recently we encountered a virus, SCAN detects whom as PrintScreen
Virus.  This virus is a boot sector based virus and writes in the hard
disk if the machine is booted with an infected floppy. If one reads
the code, its first instruction is EB21, this code uses interrupt 5
and 6D, to my wonder, how does it write in the harddisk? because no
encounters of interrupt 13 are seen.  Does any one know about it?  The
detector which we had installed (on the basis of int 13 had been
bypassed!)  Can the hard-disk be written without use of BIOS int 13?
(We have XT & ATs)

Has any one experienced similar phenomena?
thanks.

Subject: MusicBug (PC)

	Just a bit more data (still haven't seen ALL the code) but
the virus appears to be 4k long. It is stored in the boot sector (and
I would expect in the partition table of a hard disk since Michael Head
indicated that it had infected the hard disk) and seven consecutive
sectors. The original boot sector is also stored as a single sector.

	The confusing part is that the virus seems to move the storage
sectors around on each infection. Since I have not yet seen the infection
mechanism, this is not certain, but the two boot sector samples supplied
have differences in the data area used to identify the virus' storage
location. This would account for the different effects reported - one
sample put the virus right in the middle of where one of the hidden
system files would reside.

	The first sample retrieves the code in seven segments beginning
at cyl 2 hd 1 sector 1. The second sample expects them at cyl 0 hd 1
sect 9 (cyl is the same as track). Since I have not yet seen the
replication code, the algorithm used is unknown by me as yet.

	The good news is that Mr. McAfee has just released v71 and it
finds the virus in the boot sector, with the ID [Muboot]. Incidently,
a new addition to v71 is the ability to add a signature string from an
external file a la certain MacIntosh utilities for immediate tests for
new viruses. BRAVO.

This would be practically useless, as the majority of viruses these
days is not of the direct-action kind, but infect programs on
execution instead.

Besides, renaming files can lead to various problems, in the case of
packages where one program attempts to run another one - you might
have to patch many of the programs you use.

This provides nearly the same level of security as not using the hard
disk for programs, but running all software from write-protected
diskettes. That is, you cannot prevent viruses from entering your
system, if you obtain an infected program from somewhere, but you can
prevent it from spreading.

One problem, however, is that you cannot zip COMMAND.COM, so you would
have to boot from a write-protected floppy, and insert the system disk
as needed.

But they could have been corrupted before that.

Then why bother to zip them - if you assume you can clean the programs
to start with, you gain nothing extra by zipping the files.  Cleaning
will not protect you from new viruses, and there are much simpler
methods to deal with all the known ones, namely on-the fly scanning of
all programs, as they are executed.

Jerusalem does not survive warm boot, and makes no attempt to do so, but there
are several viruses known which attempt it, and also the following two cases:

The Pentagon "virus" from the Philippenes contains code clearly intended to
survive Ctrl-Alt-Del, and if it worked at all (instead of being totally unable
to infect anything) we would have a virus which could survive warm boot.

Fu Manchu intercepts Ctrl-Alt-Del, but will not survive the boot process.

The diskettes are probably from Taiwan - a country which is
practically flooded by viruses - a friend of mine ordered a machine
from a company there and received it infected with three different
viruses.

Also, every company in Iceland which imports machines from Taiwan, has
at least once received infected machines or floppies.

Well, I am glad the routine I added in version 1.13 to analyze boot
sectors for suspicious code turned out to be useful - I am working on
improvements for version 1.14

This is another case where an anti-viral program is reporting an
infection of another anti-viral program.  In all likelihood Vaccine
is finding the signature of the "DCD WORM" in SAM, Gatekeeper,
and Aid.  They may have the signature of the worm because they are
themselves scanning for its signature.

If one anti-viral program detects a virus or other nasty in another
anti-viral program, it is probably a false positive caused by the
fact that they both use (and therefore contain) the same signature.
Try scanning the supposedly infected anti-viral programs on clean
read-only distribution diskettes.  If this is indeed a signature
conflict, the clean anti-viral programs will still trigger a
false positive.

If you use two or more anti-viral or other security programs,
they are very likely to interact surprisingly, especially by
suspecting each other.  Security programs are "paranoid".  They
were designed that way and they have to be that way.

Subject: WDEF infections and combatting them (Mac)(summary)

Since posting my innocent suggestion for eliminating WDEF (rebuilding
the desktop), and a minor complaint about the idiots in my department
who continue to re-infect themselves, time and time again, I've gotten
lots of mail on the subject. In the hopes of stemming that tide, and
maybe even passing on some useful information, here are several of the
things people have told me to use, as I remember them:

1) Gatekeeper / Gatekeeper Aid. This will detect any disk that is
infected and remove the infection while u wait, apparently very
efficiently. Several reports swear by it for eliminating the kind
of recurrence that has been plaguing my department.

2) Of course, Disinfectant 2.3 (indeed, I think 2.x) detects and
can remove the virus from any disk, if the init is installed or on
regular scans of a series of disks.

3) SAM (Symantec's product) also received a couple of plaudits, but
of course, it's commercial, unlike the first two.

4) Finally, the solution I used, a nice little INIT called Eradicat'em,
kindly sent me by Dave Platt (platt@coherent.com; I sent thanks, Dave,
but my mailer is too stupid to find you. Thanks!) which, once installed,
quietly and in the background MURDERS infections of WDEF. Hah! I went
around about a week ago in the dead of night and installed it on every
machine I could get my hands on -- and this is the moderately unethical
part -- I convinced the icon not to show up on startup. Shhh. Don't
tell anyone. But magically, we have no more WDEF troubles.

And that's not my job, anyway; I'm supposed to be using my computers
to model acid rain-induced changes in lake water chemistry....now I
can get back to work ( :-), I think....)

Again, thanks to all who sent replies and comments. You can stop now.

Subject: Need info on McAffee AVS (PC)

Hello fellow netters:

I am a student consultant in the Micro support division of Information
Services at MIT. After doing an anti-viral software (AVS) evaluation,
we decided that McAffee was the best. We were able to get a price deal
if our computer store purchases in groups of 100.

Unfortunately, the store does not think anyone will buy that many
packages. They wanted to buy in groups of 25. The McAffee rep wouldn't
go that low (I don't blame him), so the computer store wants to buy from
the second choice (ViSpy) because they'll sell in groups of 25.

I think that McAffee's product is by far superior to anything else that
we have evaluated. I also think that there are a lot of people out there
that like McAffee as well as myself. This is where you people might be
able to help me!

If you like McAffee (or even if you don't) please send me email
(mlbarrow@eagle.mit.edu) telling me why you like or dislike McAffee's
package. If you dislike McAffee, please tell me which package you're
using and why you selected this package. I am willing to compile all the
responses and make them available to those that want 'em.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation & happy hunting!

No offense taken.  :-) Anyway, here's what happened: I downloaded some
info-mac listings files to my pc and was looking at them with LIST.
When I tried to move to the second file, LIST complained about my
partition table.  I ran CHKDSK and it found lost clusters so I ran
CHKDSK /V and it created 150 FILE*.CHK files.  At this point I also
found out that several files were cross-linked and that one of my
directories pointed back at the root directory.  (This one was real
fun.)  I also made the nifty discovery that my hard disk was
unbootable.  I finally gave up and downloaded SCAN and CLEAN from
Simtel20.  SCAN reported that I had Stoned in the partition table and
CLEAN fortunately was able to remove it.  Unfortunately CLEAN left C:
inaccesible but Norton Disk Doctor cured that and got rid of the
directory that was linked to root.  (Only one file in that directory
and I didn't need it anyway.)
