VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: VKILL 1.2 (PC)

          To the readers of the newsgroup comp.virus:

          I sent to Keith Petersen the new version of VKILL and it is now
available at SIMTEL under the name of VKILL12.ZIP. I also sent it to Bill
Davidsen (moderator of comp.binaries.ibm.pc) and I am waiting his answer.
Please do not ask me to send the program until I'm sure it won't be posted,
I will not answer. The main reason for this is that my link with the net
is not very good and I don't want large mails bouncing back and forth.

          Answering those who want to know what I do, I am a working on
microelectronics (design of microchips, investigating new ways of designing
them) and at home I play a lot with my PC developing a system to control
a railway layout. The reason I've done VKILL is just because I hate the guy
who made the virus...

    I just installed Life Sciences Issue 16 of Volume 33 (April 16,
1990) of Current-Contents on Diskette for Apple Macintosh Plus, SE and
II. Upon installation, Gatekeeper Aid popped up and informed me that
it had discovered and removed WDEF-A virus.

    The diskette had just been removed from the (intact) mailing
envelope from the Institute for Scientific Information. Unfortunately,
I had forgotten to move the write-protect tab, so the evidence of
infection is gone. Naturally, I cannot conclude that the disk was
actually infected (as opposed to a glitch in my Gatekeeper Aid), but
if you subscribe to this information service, please use Issue 16 with
caution.

    I have attempted to contact the publishers of this diskette, but
their tech reps haven't yet returned my calls. I'll post again after I
have spoken to them.

The ".sy" tag in input to the formatter causes the line to be passed
to the environment to be handled.  In the case noted, the environment
is CMS as a guest under VM.  By default, CMS will pass anything that
it cannot handle to the VM control program (CP).  These are two
different cases of the failure of a program to contain its own
input.

However, the case of the formatter is a much worse case, since
the user-invoker of the formatter often believes that he is dealing
with data and does not recognize the exposure to running commands.
In the case of a command handed to CMS, the user knows that he is
dealing in procedure and probably does not care which layer handles
it.  The formatter case is aggravated by the fact that the formatter
is sometimes invoked by other applications (e.g. PROFS), transparent
to the user.

IBM recognized this exposure years ago.  (From recognition of the
problem to the fix was about a month.  This is a phenomenal response
time for an institution the size of IBM and involved heroic individual
effort.)  Therefore, they placed a user control over this capability.
The IBM shipped default is to require that the ability to pass
commands through the formatter to the environment be specifically
enabled at formatter invocation time.

While this is the "safe" setting of the control, its choice was very
disruptive.  The .sy feature had existed in the formatter for more
than twelve years prior to the installation of the control.
Therefore, the choice of the safe setting as the default meant that on
the day the new control was installed, many procedures that had run
the day before would no longer run.

I can personally testify to the disruption.  On at least two
occasions, I had procedures fail because I had not specifically
enabled the use of .sy.  Even though I had participated in the
decision to install the control and ship with the safe default, it
took me a long time to recognize the problem.

I cannot tell from the comment whether the reference is to a WATERLOO
formatter or a Waterloo implementation of the IBM formatter.  If the
latter, then this may simply be a case of the installation changing
the setting to the "non-disruptive" setting.   If the former, there
may be no control, or the user may simply be seeing an installation
setting.

This is one more case that illustrates the difficulty of
distinguishing program from data.  While safe practice suggests that
they should always be separate, there is great value to the
flexibility of mixing them.  In fact they are often mixed.  Users rely
upon the separation at their peril.  This is a case some few of us know
about; there may be others.

ASQNC-TWS-RA (380-380a)                              November 89
                                                            [Revised Apr 90]

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT:  Viral Infections in Commercial/Government Software
DISTRIBUTION: Unlimited

1.  The phenomenon of computer viruses has raised concern  within
government and the private sector as to the use of public domain,
shareware and  freeware  products.   While  it  is  difficult  to
determine the source of "infections" which have occurred over the
last several years, I would propose for the purpose of discussion
that  we  who are involved in automation security services cannot
automatically exclude software  products  as  a  potential  viral
threat  simply  because  the  software  is "commercial" or simply
because software comes from "reputable" sources.  I would propose
as  well that we should be open to the suggestion that there is a
legitimate mission requirement for public domain,  shareware  and
freeware  under  the guidance provided by HQDA and our respective
System Program Managers.  Clearly it is important to have written
policies  and  procedures  to  acquire,  authorize and test "all"
software intended for use on government owned or  leased  systems
regardless of the type of software.

2.   It  seems  desirable  as  well  to  extend  our  concern  to
government developed software. The dependency of our missions and
functions  on  automation  resources  magnifies the potential for
significant disruptions were a government employee or government-
employed contractor employee to initiate a virus infection.

3.   With  that  end  in  mind  I  have  compiled  from  VIRUS-L,
RISKS-FORUM and  other  public  sources  the  following  list  of
"infections"   within   software  packages  identified  with  two
exceptions  as  commercial  and  distributed  all  by   reputable
sources.    The  two  exceptions  include  a  distribution  in  a
commercial   publication,   now   apparently   defunct,   and   a
distribution  by  the  US  Government  Printing Office for the US
Census Bureau.  The list is not complete and is not  intended  to
criticize  any  commercial  firm  or organization.  If anyone has
additional incidents,  I  would  appreciate  receiving  any  such
information so that I may update this list.  Any contributor will
receive the appropriate credit.

8.   All  of  these  infections  came from products received from
reputable sources and delivered "new." While many of the  reports
are  fragmented  and  incomplete,  there  is  enough substance to
conclude that infection of commercial products has occurred.   It
is  also  possible  to conclude that "certain" vendors have taken
elaborate safeguards to deter the  infection  of  their  products
prior to shipment.  Questions which come to mind include:

a.   Should  we  in  the  Army  require some type of random viral
detection  testing  of   commercial   software   prior   to   its
installation for production tasks?

b.   Should  software  suppliers  be  asked  to provide technical
information on what policies and procedures they have in place to
address  the potential threat of malicious software modifications
to their product, to include viral detection as a subset  of  the
malicious class?

c.  Should software acquisitions  include  some  type  of  "viral
insurance"  warranty  in  the event a supplier supplies a product
with infected code?

d.  Are policies and procedures in  place  within  Army  software
development  centers  and  activities  to  address  the potential
threat of malicious software modifications?  If so, how do  these
policies and procedures compare with those in the private sector?

Subject: Checking for 4096 (PC)

I just finished disassembling a new version of the 4096 virus and thought
of the following 'interesting' method to check if the virus was active in
memory:

          Set the date to Jan. 1. 2044
          Create a small file (smaller than 4K)
          DIR

If the file is reported as having a length of almost 4 Gigabytes, and the
creation year is AD 100, you are infected with the virus. :-)

Subject: Re: Gatekeeper 1.1.1 & Scores (Mac)

Gatekeeper Users and Other Concerned Citizens:

I recently received (through VERY indirect channels) a print of a message
that was posted to VIRUS-L which was an open letter to John Norstad
(author of Disinfectant) about an alleged bug in Gatekeeper 1.1.1,
specifically an inability to stop the Scores virus.

I'd like to tell the Gatekeeper users that may have read that message
that there is no known bug in Gatekeeper which would permit the Scores
virus to successfully spread.  Period.  This is true of *all* versions
of Gatekeeper - and I have never, ever, received a report to the
contrary.

Needless to say, if you have encountered evidence of any such failures
in your use of Gatekeeper, I really do want to hear about them.

I have over the last year-and-a-half repeatedly tested each version of
Gatekeeper against Scores (and all other known viruses) and it has
always proved effective.  (Of course Gatekeeper doesn't stop WDEF,
but that's what Gatekeeper Aid is for.)  Others have repeated those
tests both formally and informally and have always confirmed my
results.

So, I hope the Gatekeeper users who were concerned by this posting
will now sleep secure in their beds once more.

Having said that, I'd like to step up on my soapbox for few moments.

STEPPING ONTO MY SOAPBOX...

I find it highly peculiar that the person who made this posting,
who identified him or herself only as "Zav" in the printout I
received, would be willing to impune the reputation of my product
(Gatekeeper) and, by extension, me in a public letter to the
author of a completely different product.

I mean, what's the point?  Unless John Norstad happened to have
time to forward the message to me, it'd never get to me, so nothing
would ever be done about the alleged problem.  And why make John
play mail-router?  He's busy enough as it is.

The only way such information can be useful is if it is sent to
me, the product's author.  And I'm happy to help... that's why
my email address has always been included in the documentation
for both Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid.

So, I find this kind of thing *extremely* aggravating - it impunes
me and my product, worries users who have enough to worry about
anyway, and DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ACTUALLY SOLVE (or verify)
THE PROBLEM.  So, I ask again, what's the point?  Is it just
pulic spleen-venting and product bashing, or was there some
constructive purpose that I wasn't meant to find out about?

OK.  Enough of me and my soapbox.



PROBLEM REPORTS, ETC.

I'd like to, once again, publicly thank everyone who has sent me
their questions and problem reports.

For those of you who've been saving-up your problem reports here's
the addresses (pick only one :-) to send them to:

Internet: chrisj@emx.utexas.edu
UUCP:               {husc6|uunet}!cs.utexas.edu!ut-emx!chrisj
AppleLink:          chrisj@emx.utexas.edu@dasnet#

Remember to include the actual version numbers of Gatekeeper and/or
Gatekeeper Aid.

I tend to be a bit swamped with email so don't be surprised if
replies sometimes take a few days, but email is the ONLY way to
get hold of me; I get so much mail everyday that I can't read the news-
groups at all.

By the way, it's not my intention to bypass newsgroups like this; I
would encourage anyone who contacts me with a problem which they feel others
ought to know about to summarize their question and whatever answers
I'm able to provide to this newsgroup.  That way, everyone benefits.
I'd do it myself, but there are only so many hours in the day....  :-(

VERSION CHECK:

The current versions of the Gatekeeper Anti-Virus System's
components are as follows:

          Gatekeeper                    1.1.1
          Gatekeeper Aid                1.0.1

If it seems like it's been a long time since there was a new Gatekeeper
release, don't dispair:  development of new versions has been underway
for many months and will eventually result in several new and worthwhile
releases.

If you publish virus source listings, people will try to censor you and
your book and blame it for subsequent viruses.  The truth is, the
information is already spreading among underground bb's the world over.
All a legit book will do is tell non-involved folks what's going on.

From:    LBA002@PRIME-A.TEES-POLY.AC.UK
Subject: Low Level Format

          Several people on VIRUS-L have asked me to summarise the replies I ha
\cd
to my question on low level formatting and whether it is necessary to carry
out a low level format of the hard disk as part of the virus recovery process.
Here is what I think the replies said (with a general acknowledgement to the
authors of the original replies and apologies if I have misinterpreted the
information they gave me!)

1. Difference between the DOS FORMAT command and a low level format:
The DOS FORMAT command when applied to a hard disk does not perform a physical
format of the disk only a logical format. The hard disk is given a new boot
sector, a clean File Allocation Table (FAT) and an empty root directory. Thus
the file system is emptied but the file *data* remains on the disk until
overwritten by new files. When the DOS FORMAT is applied to a floppy diskette
a low level physical format is performed on the diskette as well as a logical
format.

2. How to carry out a low level format:
This is usually done at the factory or the dealer when the hard drive is mated
with a controller card. You can perform a low level format with the diagnostic
disk supplied with your PC (usually with a program called HSECT) or by executin
g
that is stored in the BIOS on the controller card (using DEBUG.) The process is
not documented and not for the squeamish! The exact instructions vary from driv
e
to drive. The low level format actually physically formats the disk, dividing
it into tracks and sectors and putting special labelling information in front
of each sector to identify it. All data on the disk is destroyed.
After you do a low level format you must Fdisk the hard disk to create a DOS
partition and then you must do a logical format with FORMAT using the /s
option to make the disk bootable.

3. Is it necessary?
Low level formatting is almost never necessary. Most viruses corrupt .COM and
.EXE files which can be restored using a disinfection program or deleted and
restored from backup copies. The only viruses which cause problems are:
Taiwan which sometimes destroys the infected program instead of properly
infecting it.
Jerusalem which occasionally corrupts a file while infecting.

Vienna and Lisbon variant which destroys 1 in 8 of the files it infects.

405 and other overwriting viruses.

With boot sectors formatting is not required. The original boot sector can be
recovered easily with the exception of the Swap (Fallboot) virus.

When cleaning up after the Dark Avenger virus it is strongly advised
to format the disk using the normal FORMAT command and restore all
programs and data files form backups. Dark Avenger may have garbled
some sectors on the disk and possibly destroyed data or program files.

There is one virus that requires low level format - when the Disk Killer virus
activates it starts encrypting the hard disk including the partition table.
DOS format can't handle this and you need to run FDISK first and possibly a
low level formatting tool.

Hope this is useful info and sorry for the length of the message.

Rgds,
