VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Where can i find MDISK?? (PC)

In the documentation of scanv60, I read that I needed the program
MDISK (OR M-DISK, another problem for Havel).  Where can I find this
program? I can use FTP, and I can deuuencode it if you mail it to me.
(I have A.T. computer using MS-DOS).

Subject: PKZ110EU.EXE - Katz's ZIP archive package v1.10, export vers.

The latest export version of Phil Katz's ZIP/UNZIP has been uploaded
to SIMTEL20.

Because of the laws restricting exporting encryption technology from
the USA and Canada, and because of the International nature of the
Internet, SIMTEL20 has elected to offer the export version which does
not offer certain file encryption features.

The "not-equals"VIR resource which you mentioned before comes from
good old Interferon. Nothing to worry about. You do have something to
worry about, though, if that's your only tool for finding viruses!

My feeling is that "viruses" should have been called "vampires", for
they change other programs into programs like themselves. But I
suppose it's too late to turn back now.

Subject: Thanks-Virus paper

 I would like to thank all the people who sent me material for my
Internet Worm paper and to appologize for not replying by e-mail to
everyone, but my mail server apparently did not like some addresses.
Anyway, to everyone who requested that I forward material to them,
please respond if you still need info (sorry I've taken so long to get
back) and tell me if you just want everything sent to you, or material
on a certain topic.  Again, I appologize for the lateness of this
post, and thank everyone for their help.

VirusX will not check hard drives...however, Steve Tibbet has included in the
archived file a program called "kv", which will check a file for any of the
known types of viri.  It should have been in the zooed (or lharced) file you
got VirusX with.

Subject: Virus in Text Files

I have heard of a concern that text files (consisting of plain ASCII text)
may contain viruses.  I had thought that only executable files such as
*.com or *.exe files were subject to viruses.  Which view is right?  Is there
risk in moving a text file from a mainframe to a PC?

Subject: virus hamming?

     hello all,

a few issues back it was mentioned that some viruses are using hamming
techniques to guard against anti-virus programs.  could someone give
me some more info about this, such as which viruses do this, where i
could get articles about viruses that do this.

thanks in advance.

As he wrote in USA, presumably the dates are in the order  'month/day/year'
and  mean "1 March 1990" and "5ish March 1990". But in European convention,
dates are written in the order 'day/month/year', and '3/1/90' means "3  Jan
1990".  As  Virus-L  is distributed to very many people outside USA, I feel
that it would be best if users  wrote  dates  with  the  month  in  letters
('Jan', 'Feb', etc), to avoid this ambiguity.

Has  someone  already  written  something  like  this?   Klaus   Brunnstein
<brunnstein@rz.informatik.uni-hamburg.dbp.de>  's  document AMIGAVIR.A89 is
said to  contain  the  classifications  of  24  viruses  including  these:-
    12) NORTH STAR I  Antivirus-Virus (NORTH STAR Virus Strain)      =U=
    13) NORTH STAR II Antivirus-Virus (NORTH STAR Virus Strain)      =U=
    19) System Z 3.0 Antivirus-Virus (System Z Virus Strain)         =U=
    20) System Z 4.0 Antivirus-Virus (System Z Virus Strain)         =U=
    21) System Z 5.0 Antivirus-Virus (System Z Virus Strain)         =+=
What are they? What do they do?
