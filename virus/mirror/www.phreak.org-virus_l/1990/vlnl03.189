Subject: Harddisk virus (Amiga)

Dear Sirs,

My harddisk (A590) has behaved strange lately.  It started when some
files (e.g. runback) ceased to be objectfiles.  When I examined them,
they contained mostly FF (HEX).  I guess one could say that they were
empty, but they were still of original size.  I deleted the files, and
replaced them with backuped stuff, and thought not much more of it.
After a while I found more files with these symptoms. Since I didn't
worry to much first time this happened, I couldn't tell if it was the
same files as the first time or new one.  At this time I noticed that
'info' claimed that 49% of DH0 was used, but I knew that it should be
more than 80% full.  A recursive listing confirmed this.  When I
booted up the machine the next the, a system request popped up.  It
said something like "Key 23046 already defined".  The harddisk
wouldn't verify, I found several readerrors, and eventually I gave up
and reformated it.

Could this be the result of a virus or trojan, or am I to blame?  Is
there any Amiga-virus that infect the harddisk?  If so, what symptoms
does it cause, and how do I get rid of it?

Yours sincerely

Subject: Sunday V. in Turbo C 2.00: is false alarm possible? (PC)

Greetings...
        Can Turbo C 2.0 execs trigger a Sunday virus alarm?  I
re-installed TC from backups of the original disks, and Sunday virus
was reported (we scan *everything* that goes into our machines) on the
following:
        TC.EXE
        INSTALL.EXE
        GREP.COM [.exe? - I forget]
        UNPACK.COM
Curiously enough, the same was reported when I checked the *original*
disk set.  We have no history of an infection.  None of the
information on any of the machines is missing/damaged.  Are we
incredibly lucky, or does Turbo C trigger the warning?  Would someone
with an ORIGINAL copy of the disk set check?  I used SCAN v67 to
verify the infection, and the same files are reported as infected.  We
would greatly appreciate any help, at this point we are really not
sure what to do...

Jan

ps.  Borland is not aware of any such problems...

Subject: new boot sector virus (PC)

We have found an unknown boot sector virus on "COMBASE" and
"SVGA-UTILITY" software shipped in PACKARD-BELL PACKMATE-III and 386sx
computers . The diskettes are in sealed envelopes.  The seal bears
characters which appear to be chinese .
 The disks were not intended to be booted and will produce the
standard error message "NON-SYSTEM DISK etc." if accidently booted,
however the harddisk if present will have been infected.
 The symptoms are varied. Some infected systems play a few notes with
every DOS command issued . On others there are no notes but there is a
lot of I/O of write protected disks (one has the feeling it is trying
to burn its way onto the disk) . Still others (my quarantined
Taiwanese AT) will not boot at all after being infected.
 Now for the bad news. SCANV67c does not report anything. F-PROT113
also doesn't find a known virus but reports the boot sector is an
unusual DOS boot sector and there may be a an unknown virus. (Thanks
Fridrik,it sure is lonely trying to convince yourself your the first
one to ever see a brand new virus).

Subject: anti-virus programs

hi everybody,

steve huff was asking about the best anti-virus & scan programs
available today. the best of these programs are : scanv67c.zip,
cleanp67.zip,m-disk.  zip or md.zip, & fprot113.zip.  scanv67c &
cleanp67 are the most popular programs worldwide, both of them can
detect and disinfect nearly 223 viruses , 67 is the current release #.
m-disk or md is a disinfector only (can't detect viruses), it woks
well with viruses that attack boot sectors or file allocation tables.
fprot113 is a great & big anti-virus package, in addition to detecting
and disinfecting you have many functions & utilities to protect,
unprotect ,change attributes, & more.  also you can find many other
programs in the simtel-20 archive:
                             <msdos.trojan-pro>
through bitnet servers: rpiecs   or   ndsuvm1, as well as a number of ftp
sites. to find out what can every program do? request this file
<msdos.trojan-pro>00-index.txt from listserv@rpiecs.
i hope this is clear, and useful. i will be glad to share information with
every one.

I Netlanders,

        Last weekend we had the worst time with virus in our labs.  We got
stoned, jerusalem'ed, ping pong'ed.

        I found a funny thing on one of the machine.  This is a tsr
file who responded when the return key is pressed.  It say that your
disk need a cleaning and ask for a confirmation.  When you agree for a
cleaning the floppy disk drive start.  Then "washing cycle" is writen
at the bottom of the screen and a washing machine sound come from the
speaker.  After that there's a spin cycle, a rince cycle and another
spin cycle with all appropriate sounds.  At the end of the process it
says that your disk is clean.

        I checked all disks and no damaged occured.  But it's kind of
funny joke.  I reset the PC and forgot to take a copy.  If a see it
again i'll take a copy and let it avalaible to the net.

        I want to appologize for my lest then poor english.

Subject: UK Computer Crime Unit

Since the passing of the Computer Misuse act of 1990, the insertion of
viral material into computer systems has become an offence which may
result in up to 5 years imprisonment. The insertion of viruses is
dealt with under the offence of unauthorised modification of computer
data, and was a problem specifically addressed in the English Law
Commission report 186 (para 3.65 (2)).

The UK police have established a central "Computer crime unit" who are
interested in monitoring all infections by computer viruses within the
UK.  This unit is currently four strong and consists of a Detective
Inspector, Detective Sergeant and two Detective constables and is
located at New Scotland Yard, London.

They are keen for any person, organisation or company infected by a
virus to report the infection. This will allow the construction of a
picture of the damage caused by the virus infection, and provide
useful background material for a prosecution if the author is ever
located.

In this regard they have asked anyone in the UK experiencing a
computer virus infection to contact:

Subject: Lateral Thinking

Hellow fellow,

two recent, seemingly unrelated, contributions to VIRUS-L deserve a
common response. My point in both cases is: When a virus is active, it
does not need to crack any anti-virus method, as it can circum- vent
it. This holds for contemporary architectures of personal computers
(note the small "p": I'm referring to all brands) and many types of
hosts. Imagine a firm door, locked with seven secure locks: If you
forget to put an equally strong wall on both sides of it, nobody will
bother with the locks nor the door! (And if the wall is in place,
don't forget the floor and the ceiling; don't forget the people and
equipment that will have to go in and out; and so on...)

An amusing variation of this motif can be found in the chapter
introductions of Douglas Hofstatter's "Goedel, Esher, Bach: an Eternal
Golden Braid", where the Turtoise keeps producing records that cannot
be played on Achilles' more and more sophisticated hi-fi record
players.

He/she (Aside: Ever thought of female virus authors? In my
imagination, virus authors are inevitably of the male sex and of age <
25 years, but I may be wrong...) can circumvent any algorithm (even a
bitwise compare to a backup-copy) by simply interfering with all
disk-read operations and presenting any programs reading an infected
file with a (faked!) image of the unaltered file. This is exactly what
"Stealth Viruses" do.

That's exactly the point: To check for viruses, you have to start your
system without activating any virus. E.g. you can boot from a
confirmed clean system disk and avoid running any infected program.

> what am I missing?

Nothing.

Neither did I. Possibly the originial contribution has confused it with
some other virus that indeed can survive a warm boot.

As you have noted yourself, a virus can intercept the Ctrl-Alt-Del
keystroke (we call it the "Monkey's Snatch"). Then it can do anything
the programmer can imagine. E.g. it could fake a warm-boot by reading
something from the A-disk (this would fool many users, perhaps even
experienced ones). Or it could perhaps use part of the Int-19-code,
keeping controll during the whole process (or making sure that it will
re-gain controll, afterwards). The latter scheme has been discussed in
VIRUS-L before, and I think we arrived at the conclusion that a virus
must be rather large and sophisticated to do this with any DOS
variant; however, a virus need not deal with any and all systems to
prosper.

> ... doing a reboot with int 19h, this would be difficult.

I think, no virus would be able to survive a genuine, complete re-boot
in memory AND re-gain controll. (Take this as an educated guess, as
I'm no expert with system internals.)

Hence the motif reappers: Circumvent what cannot be cracked.

Best wishes
            Otto

USSR installations have been hit many times by various "Bulgarian"
viruses.  Bulgaria was a significant supplier of hardware and software
for the Soviets, although I suspect it is much less so now.  Reports
have also been given about these viruses spreading through Eastern
Bloc nations.  A brief discussion on this is found in my COMPUTERWORLD
article, "Lack in the USSR" (Aug. 20, 1990, InDepth, 73-74).

	One way of insuring that the SCAN or F-PROT programs are
legitamate is for the authors to ZIP their program with the -AV
(Authenticate Verification) switch on.  That way if the programs were

Yes, whenever I make vacation plans, I always worry that a new virus
will show up just before I leave or while I'm gone.  This time it
happened - I got the new ZUC B virus late last Tuesday, and I left for
my vacation on Wednesday morning.

Fortunately, the original ZUC A virus was never widespread, and we
have no reason to believe that ZUC B is widespread or terribly
damaging or dangerous.  So I figured that Disinfectant 2.4 could wait
for a week or so while I was gone.

Here at Helsinki University of Technology we have had Dark Avenger
twice, first time last fall, when it supposedly came with a Bulgarian

Since the Dark Avenger spreads very eagerly, I would not be surprised
if it were common. Other common viruses in Finland are at least
PingPong and Yankee Doodle.

I strongly recommend Patricia Hoffman's Virus Summary List (PC) and
the Disinfectant by John Norstad (MAC) documentaion (both available
from any number of electronic sources as REQUIRED reading. Having
access to a VAX, the SEARCH command allows selective extraction and
resorting of just about anything. On the PC, Q&A (by Symantec I think)

>Subject: Removal of EDV? (PC)

These are both boot sector infectors. The Yale/Alameda originally just
infected 360k floppies and the EDV could also infect the Partition
Table though heaven only knows what varients have been cooked up. From
floppies, just replace the boot sector using DEBUG (L100 0 0 1 with a
good floppy in A and W100 0 0 1 with an infected floppy in A),
however, any sector overwritten or marked bad by the virus will remain
that way. (the bad sectors can be recovered, overwritten data cannot)
According to my data, the Yale stores the original boot sector at head
0 track 39 sector 8. The EDV stores it at head 1 track 39 sector 8.
Both go resident at the TOM & reduce total system memory (CHKDSK or
the three bytes again).

As to EDV surviving CLEAN, I have seen cases of Ghosting (viral code
still attached to a file or in memory but disconnected from the execution
path) & would suggest following CLEAN by:
        1) COLD (power off) boot from a clean floppy. POST should wipe memory.
        2) use DEBUG to read the HD partition table & boot record
        3) if ok, boot from the HD, check for the TOM movement & run SCAN
           again. If the /m finds it in memory BELOW the 640k segment & CHKDSK
           returns 655360 bytes (640k) total memory, one of the files in
           CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT used to be infected & is ghosting -
           try copying these files to a floppy and back to the HD in a
           different place. The smaller floppy cluster size should strip the
           remnant off.
NOTE: this is not a one-size-fits-all procedure: TOM is only ONE of the "three
      bytes" but will work for Yale/Alameda or EDV original recipes.

p.s. I would rather have a few "false positives" thatn ANY "false negatives"
